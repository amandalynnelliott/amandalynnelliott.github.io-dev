Oftentimes when I’m drawing in public, people will approach me and say “I wish I could draw,” to which I’ll look at their hands and ask, “Why can’t you?!”

People were creating art in caves before they considered themselves artists–before the pronoun “I” ever existed. It’s human nature to express ourselves in the mediums at our disposal. The meaning of the world is made–not found, and we make it in forms of our art, music, poetry, and movies.

But by the time we reach adulthood the courage to express oneself is almost completely snuffed out. When adults put pencil to paper and they aren’t able to produce anything amazing on the first try, they assume they are talentless and never try again.

To combat this, I’ve recently hosted a workshop series called “I can’t draw,” and here is it in blog post form. The first step is the simplest, but also the hardest.

### 1. Waste paper

Despite popular belief, I do not know of a single baby to have left the womb a talented artist. Just like any other skill, creating art takes practice, dedication, and time.

I can’t draw either, to tell you the truth, *but I draw anyways*.

Self portraits – Two years of practice makes a big difference!
The first part of the workshop was simple. I put a stack of cheap printer paper in the middle of the table, along with some sharpened pencils, and I told the group to have at it–to doodle!

And… nothing happened.

After a few more minutes of coaxing, something miraculous happened. I was in a room of adults doodling on cheap paper–freely expressing themselves in ways that they probably haven’t since they were five years old.

If you go into a room of kindergartners and ask who there is an artist, every child will eagerly shoot up their hand. But if you go into a room of high schoolers and ask that same question, you’d be lucky to see even one hand rise.

Over time we lose the confidence to create. We become afraid of being judged and ridiculed. We become indoctrinated into only doing work that has correct answers, and we forget how to do the work that has none.

The solution? Don’t be afraid to look stupid! Embrace that you are now on the edge of limitless possibilities and potential screw-ups. The goal is not to create something amazing, but to simply *create*.

What’s the difference between good artists and just-okay artists? Good artists don’t show people their bad work, but they still make quite a bit of it, especially in the beginning. Always remember that whatever you create doesn’t have to be shown. It can be your little guilty pleasure.

Find the nearest sheet of paper and a writing utensil and go crazy. Draw swirls. Straight lines. Draw simple shapes. Draw how you feel. Then once you have that page filled up, go on to the next one. Use the cheapest supplies so you don’t worry about wasting money. Set out to waste a few sheets of paper a day and you’ll improve your drawing skills in no time.

The first step is to regain confidence in yourself. **You *are* an artist. You *can* create. You have amazing potential.** Once you embrace your ability to self express again, it’s like the world opens up to you. Your art is your vehicle to take us to places we have never seen before.

### 2. Hand-eye Coordination

Once you have regained confidence in your newly discovered hands, you can work on building up your fine motor skills by drawing what is around you.

Look to see objects for what they are, not how they appear. Objects are three-dimensional, but the goal is to represent them on a two-dimensional surface. “Art is a lie that tells the truth,” right? (Pablo Picasso quote) All three-dimensional forms, even something as complex as the human body, can be broken down into these few simple forms.

With some practice shading, just like a magic trick, you can transform a flat circle into a solid sphere. Once you’ve mastered that, then you can accurately render anything at your disposal.

### 3. Capture Humanity

When I started drawing people they seemed lifeless. It wasn’t until I came across a description in [Force: Dynamic Life Drawing for Animators](http://www.amazon.com/Force-Dynamic-Life-Drawing-Animators/dp/0240808452) that I discovered why.

When you eventually graduate from drawing simple forms to drawing more complex things, like people and animals, you have to remember that they aren’t static. Lifeforms have energy, motion, and emotion, all expressed through their form. All of which can be expressed and exaggerated.

It’s not about drawing the person, it is about *capturing their humanity*. With cell-phone cameras in everybody’s pockets today, it’s hard to imagine a time when it was difficult to capture visual image. But when I go out to draw people, I like to put myself in the shoes of a Civil War artist. Of course there were cameras during the Civil War, but they were slow. They could only capture the aftermath of battles, not the action itself. To combat this, many artists were enlisted to accompany soldiers into battle to capture historic events in ways the camera wasn’t yet able to. This was a dangerous task, as many artists were wounded and killed along with the soldiers fighting.

Putting myself in a time period where art-making was a necessity to capture events brings importance and meaning to any simple sketches I do that day.

### 4. Exaggerate

Oftentimes what makes an image interesting or funny is the fact that it is exaggerated. Heinrich Kley (1863-1945) was an illustrator who was masterful at exaggeration. He even inspired Walt Disney.

You can see that from carefully studying animal anatomy he’s able to exaggerate them by giving them very playful and human-like characteristics.

### 5. Explore and Experiment

Certain mediums you’ll be drawn to just because they feel right, and it’s good to experiment to discover just what those mediums are. Every medium has pros and cons, some of which you’ll find more important than others. I made this downloadable [Art-Medium-PRO-CON list]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/cc/art/Art-Medium-PRO-CON-list.odt) to help you in your exploration.

First you expand your horizons, try everything you can, try oil paints, watercolors, graphite, charcoal, and then eventually you focus in on a few because they’ll start to feel like home. At first I explored all kinds of mediums, but now I have found home in the realm of fountain pens and ink.

### 6. Style?

“Style is overrated. It’s merely a habit of drawing. Everyone has a unique style because everyone has a unique life.”

I used to worry a great deal about style a couple of years ago. And after making art for a few years, you might find yourself dwelling on the same thing.

The solution is not only simple, but very fun. Create a swipe file, or a file containing work from the artists that you admire the most. (I got this idea from [Steal Like an Artist](http://www.amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253).)

In creating your swipe file you’ll discover the kind of art that you want to create. Humans are incapable of creating exact copies, and, as long as you don’t plagiarize, “stealing” from a ton of artists will make original. In studying from your idles, you’ll become an awesome re-mix of them all.

Here are two artists from my swipe file.

Italy based editorial illustrator, [Emiliano Ponzi](http://www.emilianoponzi.com/), makes work that is global, but not generic. He communicates complex ideas in simple images that transcend language barriers. He is a powerful illustrator, able to communicate visually what words alone cannot.

<img class="gallery-emiliano" src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/cc/art/gallery-emiliano/1.jpg"> 

Chinese-American, [Victo Ngai](http://victo-ngai.com/), is also an editorial illustrator, but makes work that is more complicated. You can easily become immersed in the stunningly beautiful worlds she creates. Sometimes they take my breath away.

It was through my swipe file that I discovered that I am more of a drawer–not a painter (which helped bring an end to frustrating string of hopeless attempts at concept art :-P), and that I admire thought-provoking illustrations designed for editorials. As you progress as an artist and curate your own swipe file, you’ll make similar discoveries.

## My Portfolio Sneak-peak

You can see trends from my swipe file in my work

This illustration I did based on the heat wave that hit the United Kingdom in the summer of 2013. The buildings there weren’t designed to handle that kind of heat, leading to hundreds of deaths.

I was going to show more of my illustrations, but I’m saving them for future posts. ;-) You can also find all of the work I’ve made for this blog in the [archives]({{ site.url }} LINK HERE ).

### Artist FAQ

- *I’d love to draw __, but I don’t know what __ looks like!* Reference images are at your disposal! Use Google image search, get a picture book at the library, or get outside and find what you want to draw in-person. You have no shortage of options to obtain visuals today. Reference images are one of your greatest assets.
- *I have no idea what to draw.* Make a list of 100 things you’d like to draw. Problem solved. Also checkout the drawing exercises ([Art-I cant draw- recap- and exercises]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/cc/art/Art-I-cant-draw-recap-and-exercises.odt)) we do at drawing workshops.
- *Drawing __ is so frustrating!* Set out to draw 100 sketches of __, and it won’t be frustrating anymore.
- *I can’t come up with any ideas.* My favorite brainstorming exercise for artist block is to grab a friend and have a doodle war. Yes, that’s right, a doodle WAR. Start off by drawing your starting character, and then have your friend draw something attacking your character. Then draw something defending or attacking back. Continue the chain until one party surrenders or the entire page is filled up. The laws of physics need not apply.
- *No matter how hard I work I don’t seem to get better.* Creative energy doesn’t flow when you are tensed up. The key to making good work is to relax. Doodle a lot, take a break, and let other artists give you advice. It might take time to get to where you want to be, but with determination you will get there. It’s not how good you are, it’s how good you want to be. You’ll also find that the best work seems to come when you aren’t over-thinking it.

So the next time you are drawing in public and somebody approaches you asking if you are an artist, I suggest you respond as I do: Yes, aren’t you? Isn’t everybody?
