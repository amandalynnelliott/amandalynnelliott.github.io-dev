“Follow your passion” seems like great advice, until you realize that your passion is difficult to profit from (at least currently) or that you don’t have a defined passion at all.

So if you are hungry for a paycheck, *now*, rather than waiting the years needed for your skills and connections to be strong enough to profit from passion, and rather than waiting years to try to abstractly define what your passion even is, then here are some easy-to-implement money-making ideas that can put money in your pocket and give you experience *today*.<!--more-->

### Money Making Basics

I recently started a Cheating College meetup group, and at the last meeting local businessman, Brent Pearson, shared what he’s learned from navigating the job market as a college dropout, bouncing from odd job to odd job, until finally finding stability in business.

Brent has been running a wholesale business with his wife out of their home for twelve years. This post is based on the awesome advice and easy to implement money-making ideas he gave at the meeting.

> To make money, you have to do something for others that they want done, but that they don’t want to–or can’t–do themselves.

You make money by selling a product or service (or by working for a company that does) that specifically addresses a consumer’s specific need, desire, or problem. *The more people that don’t want to do–or are unable to do–the task, the higher the pay.*

This is why artists make so little money while garbage men are well paid. Because everyone wants to make art and nobody wants to haul garbage.
I made this equation to illustrate this concept.

The value you add is directly proportional to the difficulty of the task you do (the rarer your skills, the higher your pay), and inversely proportional to the number of people willing and able to do that task.

If you are self-employed, your livelihood also depends upon your audience size, or your number of potential customers or clients. If you are employed, unless that’s your specific job, you don’t have to worry about that.

### Should you be job-hunting or pursuing self-employment?

There are pros and cons to both paths, and you don’t have to settle on one or the other. They are both based on the same principles.

<blockquote>
“It’s not the employer who pays the wages. Employers only handle the money. It’s the customer who pays the wages.”

</blockquote>

**Employers are basically middle men between you and the value you add to people.**

**When employed, you create more value than you earn.** For a company to pay you X dollars, you have to be adding more than X value to that company. That’s the giveaway, since you don’t have to worry about the specifics of creating a company, or of creating a system of cash generation and building a customer base.

If the thought of being your own boss, of seeking out your own clients or customers, and building your own cash generation system from scratch, scares you, then being employed is a good deal. You can get paid to do your specific task, and you don’t have to worry about the rest.

If on the other hand, the thought of being your own boss, and taking the responsibilities that come with it, invigorates you, then I’m glad to tell you that it’s simpler than you think.

### If You are Job Hunting

Summer in full swing now, getting a part-time job is extremely difficult, seeing as how so many students secured their summer jobs months ago.

To ease some of the headaches, first address how you are conducting your job hunt. Where are you conducting your search? The first place we’re inclined to look is at online job boards, which makes sense, except that only *20 percent of available jobs get posted to internet job boards.*

> Eighty percent of available jobs never get posted to online job boards, but instead get filled through networking and employee recommendations.

While networking produces better job-hunting results, I think networking is an odd term. It’s like meeting people because you want something. **Instead of interacting with people just because YOU want something, why not meet people because you want to give THEM something?** If you show that you can add value, then you’ll get much better results in your job hunt.

*When networking, also remember to mention the type of work you’re interested in doing, and to especially ask for referrals to people who are already doing that kind of work.*

To learn what makes a successful job hunt, checkout this fluid site, [50 Ways to Get a Job](http://50waystogetajob.com/).

In the name of networking, I have been using and loving the site [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/), which is one of the best ways to join local clubs of people that meet in person regularly. There is a group for almost every topic, but if you want one in particular and it doesn’t exist, then you can create it.

### Job Ideas

- **[House-sitting](http://www.collegerebellion.com/house-sitting-long-term-travel-made-possible/)**. The thought of getting paid to sit in somebody’s house and water their plants and care for their animals while they’re on vacation, is fantastic.
- **Teaching English overseas.** Getting ESL certified to teach English is not that difficult, and it allows you to earn money while you travel for cheap.
- **Substitute teaching.** Substitute teachers have the freedom to pick their schedules and what age group of kids they work with. You can start with just a high school education or equivalent.
- **Telemarketing.** This might not be your first choice, but since it’s such an unpopular profession, it’s basically an instant job, and the sales experience could be invaluable.

## If You are Pursuing Self-Employment

When I was at a doctor’s appointment, a chatty and friendly receptionist asked what I was going to do now that I graduated high school (basically asking what college I was going to go to). I surprised her by saying that I was going to start a business. Her eyes glazed over and with a blank stare, she said, “YOU’RE gonna start a business?” It hurt my ego a bit, but she acted like many people do when they think of business. That you need a buttload of money to start, and that it’s some mystical process that the majority of us mere mortals were not “chosen” to do.

That, of course, is not true.

> “Any idiot can start a business,” said Brent Pearson with a laugh.

**It wasn’t meant as an insult, just the truth that many people in business have no idea what they’re doing, but still do just fine.** 

Sometimes I think of the receptionist that doubted me so much. Maybe she acted that way because I didn’t have a business degree. Like I said in my [college decision flowchart post]({{ site.url }}/blog/2014/05/college-flowchart/), you don’t need a degree, or permission, to start a business because you don’t need permission to start helping people and to start solving their problems.

In fact,  sometimes getting a business degree is a hindrance instead of an opportunity. Surprisingly, most [business graduates from Harvard](http://liveyourlegend.net/how-business-school-killed-the-entrepreneur-and-some-worthy-alternatives/) end up becoming miserable financial advisers and investors, too ladled with student debt to take the moderate financial risks and time from full-time work necessary to start something, as they had originally planned.

*The certificate, the permission, only matters if you are seeking employment. But if you want to seek self-employment, you should incur as little debt as possible.*

If you do want to pursue a business degree, a good college education will not tie you to life long debt. It will teach you how to learn, not what to learn, and will be highly dependent on having great instructors.

The basic skills you should develop to become self-employed are:

- Marketing, or your ability to get people who don’t know about you to know about you, and
- Sales, or your ability to get people who know about you to become your customers.

While these words might make you cringe and remind you of telemarketers and used-car salesmen, there are honest and non-annoying ways to provide value to people and build your livelihood around it. Starting a blog, for example, is a great example of *permission*-marketing, where your audience comes to *you* for the value you provide, as opposed to you spreading spam through the internet that does nothing but annoy people.

**If you want to start something, don’t let people discourage you.** Get intense feedback from the people who have started things before, and take the advice from others with a grain of salt.

Pursuing self-employment, either through freelance work (where you directly provide a service to clients as an individual), or by starting a business (by creating something bigger than yourself), it’s all about seizing opportunities and building trust with your audience and customers.

> Self-employment is the act of addressing a need, addressing a desire, or solving a problem for people. Money is not something that only comes from a select few mystical and “chosen” sources. It comes from people.

**You can become a job creator, and by that I *don’t* mean that you can or should create a lot of jobs. I mean that you can create YOUR job.** You may be wondering, “Well, how do I do that if I’m not rich?” But you don’t need lots of money, and in fact, it’s better if you don’t. Less money invested means less risk.

It’s less about starting with money as it is about starting with trust. If you don’t have trust, you don’t have a business.
For further information about self-employment, I highly recommend listening to [Seth Godin’s Startup School podcasts](http://www.earwolf.com/show/startup-school/).

### Brent’s easy-to-implement money-making ideas are:

- Offer to sell merchandise online for people through eBay for commission. An ideal customer base here would be the elderly population, who have accumulated a lot of stuff but might lack the computer skills needed to sell it online. To build a client base, you can ask people in your network and post a Craigslist add.
- Go to garage sales and offer to buy them out in cash at the end of the week for whatever they don’t sell. Lowball the value, because they will be dying to get rid of the stuff anyway, and resell the merchandise online.
- Go to independent local stores and, for commission, offer to sell their merchandise online.
- Offer to teach people (typically older) how to use their computer.
- Offer to teach people how to sell their stuff online.
- Buy merchandise in bulk for cheap directly from foreign manufacturers, and resell it under your US locale. The merchandise you buy might have many defects, so be wary of getting ripped off and make sure to weed out the defective parts before reselling. However, the margins will be good and people will be willing to pay more to buy from you because they’ll trust your US location over foreign locales.
- Sell electronics or out-of-print books (even if the kindle version is available).

### What I Learned from My Failed Dog Walking Business

Brent’s advice also helped me realize what I was doing wrong in my own money-making endeavors.

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/cc/dog-walking.png)

The dog walking business that I *attempted* to start these the last few months has not been going well. I spent a decent amount of time making these fliers and splashing them around my neighborhood multiple times, but only got one call from a potential customer who already had a dog walker, but wanted me as a back-up just in case.
Even though I didn’t get the outcome I was hoping for, I have learned from the experience. The good thing is that I didn’t lose any money. I didn’t invest any money in this endeavor, except for the cost to print fliers and a few hours of my time.

Here are some mistakes I’ve made and have learned from.

- **I didn’t put my picture on the fliers.** Putting your face on your fliers and business cards builds trust, and makes people more likely to contact you for your services.
- **I only put fliers on stop-signs and not on people’s individual driveways.** Even though I put the fliers on stop-signs, people are unlikely to write down a phone number when they’re in the car headed somewhere.
- **I didn’t talk to dog owners directly.** I’m typically shy when it comes to my neighbors, but I missed some great opportunities to introduce myself and my service to dog owners when I saw dog owners out and about.
- **I didn’t post a Craigslist add.** Maybe my reach wasn’t far enough.

**Another reason why maybe my dog walking service didn’t take off is because my neighborhood that I tried this in is middle class and suburban.** A wealthier neighborhood, a neighborhood in the city where dog-walking is a hassle, or at an elderly community living area where it’s more difficult for people to walk dogs, would have produced better results. Though I have quite a few dog-owners in my neighborhood, a dog walking service might not be needed here because walking dogs here is not a hassle for most people–at least not enough of a hassle to pay money for.

I would, however, recommend starting a dog walking business to anybody who loves dogs and is looking for some extra cash. Summertime is a great time to do it if you also incorporate dog-sitting, because many people leave for vacations in the summertime and want to make sure their dogs are well cared for. If you can be competitive with pricing with local kennels, then you’ll have it made.

## Additional Money-Making Ideas

To see what your money-making possibilities are, make a chart similar to this.

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/cc/skills-chart.png)

By brainstorming with the above template, I have come up with the following money-making opportunities.

- **Freelance illustrating.** Even though I’ve been posting my work extensively on social media, most of the people that see my work don’t need an illustrator. I’ve discovered a few websites that are specifically for illustrator-seekers. I’ll put out my work, and see what happens. I’ll also create a portfolio site for the sole purpose of displaying my artwork.
- **Life coach people that go to the local community college.** Talking to random strangers about their life goals and ambitions makes me a little apprehensive, which is all the more reason to do it. 
- **Go to independent local businesses and offer to set up their websites, do their design branding, or set up their online store.** I’ve gotten experience with web design and WordPress from setting up this blog, and I could use that skill. This is an extension of Brent’s idea to offer to sell a physical store’s merchandise online for commission. For this idea, I’d want to get business cards with my face printed on them.

### Final Thoughts

I hope I gave you lots of ideas to try out for your job-hunting or self-employment endeavors for your quest to become financially independent. If you have any questions or problems to address, feel free to message me directly.
