These four goal-setting techniques are exercises that I’ve done while bootstrapping my own alternative higher education.

I’ve used these techniques exclusively to stay motivated to build this website, host workshops, public speak, and to generally be a rather productive unemployed nineteen-year-old. (Who says the unemployed aren’t busy? ;-) )

This post will be long, but also hopefully also tremendously beneficial.

Before diving into the techniques, let’s examine the ultimate life goal: living without regret.<!--more-->

### Keep in mind the top 5 regrets of the dying.

Living life without regret is an all-encompassing goal that we all should keep in mind when dreaming and setting goals. [As reported by hospice workers](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/03/top-5-regrets-of-the-dying_n_3640593.html), the most common regrets of fellow men and women on their deathbeds surprisingly hit close to home:

1. I wish I’d had the courage to live life true to myself, not the life that others expected of me.
2. I wish I hadn’t worked so hard.
3. I wish I’d had the courage to express my true feelings.
4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
5. I wish that I had let myself be happier.

Think about these regrets. Write them down. Have you been making sure live a regret-free life, or are you walking into the same mistakes?

Keeping those in mind, ask yourself about the goals that you are currently working towards. *Are you happy that you are currently working towards these goals?*

Oftentimes we start life working towards the collective definition of success (good grades, money, fame). We learn that happiness will come from these external rewards, but it doesn’t. The happiness that comes from good grades and accumulating money and rewards is fleeting and superficial.

Lasting happiness comes from internal fulfillment, from how you spend your time, not your money. From how you help others, not yourself. You have to make sure that you are living life true to yourself, and not the life that others want for you. Are the goals that you are currently working towards true to yourself?

**Are you working too hard?** Are you sacrificing happiness in the present to save it for some distant future that may never come?

**Are you losing touch with your loved ones, your family and friends?** Are you getting too caught up in your individual achievements that you are losing sight of the people who make living beautiful? Have your dogs not been walked in a long time? *sad puppy dog face*

**Are you hiding your true self for fear that others won’t accept you?** Can you stir up the courage to allow yourself to be happier by not being afraid of public criticism? Are you willing to accept it if some people think you are stupid, boring, weird, or even a little nuts?

It’s not a question of whether or not you’ll be “successful,” it’s a question of if you’ll be successful by YOUR definition. Hopefully, the following techniques will help you define what success means to you, and can help you start living a full life without regret.

### 1. Are you your own worst enemy? Write down all the things you tell yourself to keep yourself from building the life you want.

To turn dreams into goals, first we must start with the dreams. Phrases like, “*I would love to, but I can’t because…*” are forbidden. “I can’t” is a mindset that will only hold you back.

When dreaming, it’s important to forget the current likelihood of such events. Forget cost, forget time, forget your current abilities. If it were easy, then everybody would be doing it.

Write down the things that you tell yourself to keep you from doing the things and starting the projects that matter to you. For example, here are some reasons I would use to keep myself from starting this very blog.

- People will get angry at my alternative education opinions.
- It’s too soon.
- It’s too late.
- It’s never been done before.
- It’s been done before.
- People won’t care about my work.
- People won’t accept me for who I am.
- I’m not good enough.
- I don’t know how.

I even contradicted myself! The lengths we go to in order to avoid hard and meaningful work! From writing down these reasons, you’ll realize the flaws in your thinking.

- People will get angry at my alternative education opinions. –> *So far, that hasn’t even happened.*
- It’s too soon.
- It’s too late. –> *The timing is never right. Do it anyways.*
- It’s never been done before. –> *Great! You’ll be a pioneer!*
- It’s been done before. –> *Not with your personal flair. No it hasn’t.*
- People won’t care about my work. –> *The right people will care. Find them, and dedicate everything you make to them.*
- People won’t accept me for who I am. –> *People who matter will accept you for who you are. Forget the people who don’t.*
- I’m not good enough. –> *You are more than good enough, and you can accomplish amazing things.*
- I don’t know how. –> *But you can learn.*

Seth Godin’s free downloadable PDF, [The ShipIt Journal: A Little Pamphlet for People Who Can](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/files/theshipitjournal.pdf), is a great workbook to get the naysayers in your head to hush up so that you can start being productive. If you would like to explore this exercise further, I highly recommend printing it out. (Page 8 especially)

To break the “I can’t” mindset, I also recommend ordering a copy of Blake Boles’ freshly printed book, [The Art of Self-Directed Learning](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Self-Directed-Learning-Unconventional-Education/dp/0986011959/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1409451941&sr=1-1&keywords=the+art+of+self-directed+learning+blake+boles). In the book, Blake calls this “cages and keys.” We have a way of putting ourselves in mental cages. We say things like “I can’t” and “I don’t know how,” and that keeps us from ever trying. But breaking out of the cage is as simple as changing our attitude by finding the key.

### 2. Prioritize Success Like Warren Buffet

This exercise is one of the many gems you get when you email subscribe to [LiveYourLegend.net](http://liveyourlegend.net/). Grab a sheet of paper, because this will require some work!

1. **Scratch your brain to make a list of 25 goals/ dreams**- places you want to see, people you want to meet, things you want to do, person you want to be. It’s important to think up a lot, because doing so will help you remember the dreams that you’ve suppressed because you never even gave them a chance. Snowboarding, traveling to Thailand, learning a language, running a marathon, scuba diving, starting a business, meeting somebody you idolize. *Nothing is off limits.*
2. **Circle your top 10 dreams from the list.** This will be difficult, but narrowing down your goals is important.
3. **Now from that, narrow down to your top 5 goals.** Marry these five goals, and put the rest on the back burner. If you are working on too many things at once, you won’t get anything done. Progress will only come from focused and deliberate work. How long will it take you to build a finished house if you start building a hundred houses at the same time?
4. **Prioritize your top 5 goals.** Which is the most important? Which is the least?

Great! Now you have your top five dreams turned into goals. Now, looking at them, they probably seem intimating, if not even downright impossible. That’s where dreammapping comes in.

### 3. Break down your goals into smaller goals. Make a dreammap.

Oftentimes it’s easier to think of how to achieve our goals abstractly as opposed to chronologically. That’s where dreammapping, an idea I got from [Zero Tuition College](http://www.ztcollege.com/resources/CWHSFinal-DreamMapping.pdf), comes in handy.

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/cc/dream.png)

It’s refreshing to illustrate again. Here is the dreammap template.

Grab a new sheet of paper, and write down each of your five goals, each in its own little bubble, with room to grow.

Then expand from those goals with more bubbles filled with the things that you can do to achieve them. What tasks can you do in the near future to realize that goal? Steps that you can to take? Things you need to learn, places you can go, or people who can help you?

Here’s the first dream map I made.

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/cc/dreammap.png)

You’ll notice, that embarrassingly, one of my goals was to “Revolutionize education.” That’s a highly unrealistic goal (and a cocky one at that), but more on the risk of unrealistic goals at the end of this post.

Also make sure that your goals are measurable so that you can keep track of progress. For example, instead of setting a goal to “Get healthier,” make it to “Lose 20 pounds,” “Learn a new organic recipe every week for a month,” or to “Cut out processed foods from my diet for six days out of the week for a month.” Only if the goal is measurable, will you be able to–*cough*–measure it.

### 4. Make a Dreamline – dream timeline

<blockquote>
“A goal is a dream with a deadline.”
<footer>–Napoleon Hill</footer>
</blockquote>

Now it’s time to bring, well, *time* into the picture. How long do you want to work towards these goals? How long is too long? How much money invested is too much? Or is it a goal that you hope to work towards indefinitely for the rest of your life, or until you decide otherwise?

When it comes to a money-making project idea, it’s good to make it a definite goal by setting time and money limits so that you don’t expend too many resources on a pipe dream. Oftentimes, it’s smart to test the market before even investing resources into creating the product or service you have in mind. (You can learn more about market testing and my failed dog-walking business in [Passion is Great, But I Need Money NOW]({{ site.url }}blog/2014/06/passion-is-great-but-I-need-money-now/).)

But my goal of writing weekly posts for this blog, on the other hand, is an example of an *indefinite goal*. I’ll write, illustrate, and share content until I die, or until I find that it doesn’t make me happy anymore. It’s okay to have these goals too, but it’s *important* to know that they are goals without an end.

</figure>

As I expressed in [Unmotivated: Groundfloor and the Dip]({{ site.url }}/ LINK HERE), when working towards goals, *especially* indefinite goals, it’s important to make point A your destination, not point B. It’s important to make happiness gained from working *in the present* your goal, not some postponed happiness in the future. The dip (pictured above) should refer to the amount of effort you need to put in, *not* your happiness. **Don’t sacrifice yourself in the present to achieve some goal in the future, because that future may never come, and that success that results won’t feel true.**

Keeping that in mind, make three different chronological plans of what tasks you are going to do to make progress in realizing your goals. Excel spreadsheets works great for this, or try Tim Ferris’ (the author of the 4 Hour Workweek) [dreamline downloadable](http://fhww.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/dreamlineworksheet1.1.xls).

Make one plan for 3 months into the future, one for 6 months, and one for a year. Transfer your actionable steps from your dreammap to your dreamlines. The most relevant plan will be the 3-month one, because as you keep working towards your goals, they’ll evolve with you.

Doing that concludes the goal-setting techniques. Now, let’s look at further crucial steps to sticking to those goals.

### Drop toxic people.

Dropping people who will put you down or hold you back is imperative to making progress. Surround yourself with positive and inspiring people, and you’ll find yourself doing positive and inspiring things.

When it comes to working towards dreams, gaining knowledge and skills is only part of it. Building community is the very important other side of the coin. Make sure not to learn in a vacuum, and don’t be afraid to ask for help.

### How to Stay Accountable

**Weekly reflections are a great way to monitor your progress. Set aside an hour or two every week to reflect.** For me, it’s every Sunday morning. Ask yourself, what did you do? What did you learn? Where did you go? Who did you meet? This is tremendously more effective if you write it down.

<figure>

</figure>

After reflecting, plan your upcoming week. What’s left to accomplish to realize your five goals? What tasks take top priority? What obligations do you have coming up?

I like to end each weekly reflection with a sheet entirely dedicated to listing what I want to accomplish in the upcoming week. If you’re like me, when doing this you’ll egregiously overestimate what you can accomplish in seven days. If that happens, narrow down your workload by circling only four tasks in your list. If you accomplish these four things in a week’s time, then you’ve made progress! If not, then it’s time to get to work!

Another great thing about weekly reflections is that you can consolidate them into six-month and annual reviews. The rewarding feeling you get from getting to do that is indescribable.

If you have trouble sticking with goals, try posting them online, like I did. Sharing your goals online is like a form of “soft” peer-pressure.

**If you doubt your self-discipline with weekly reflections alone, you can also ask a friend to be your accountability partner, or you can even form an accountability “master mind” group.** Make sure to connect regularly with motivated friends with weekly phone calls or in-person meetings. This works wonderfully because it’s mutual accountability, and with people supporting you and regularly being updated with your progress, you’ll be more motivated to stick with it.

Whether you decide to keep your accountability solo or social is up to you. Personally, I find it helpful to constantly ask myself the question, “*Do I feel fulfilled?*” If the answer is yes, then I happily waste time, relax, play video games, and watch Netflix. If the answer is no, then I get to work. 

The goal is to feel productive, *without* working yourself to death. Always remember to schedule in that important free time that’s vital to creativity and sanity!

### The Risks of Dreaming Big: Blind Optimism & Depression

Randolph Nesse, a researcher searching for the evolutionary purpose of depression, theorizes that depression may be an adaptive mechanism to prevent us from falling victim to blind optimism. After all, it’s to our evolutionary advantage not to waste time and energy on goals that we can’t realistically achieve. **Experiencing mild depression is our body and mind’s way of telling us that we need to stop expending resources on the wrong goals.**

During this period of mild depression, Nesse theorizes, we can conserve our resources and search for more realistic goals. Being depressed is a state of being extremely inactive because it’s a time to stop, slow down, and find more achievable goals to direct your energy to. But what if we persist in pursuing unattainable goals? Well, then *severe* depression kicks in.

It’s depressing to spend our lives working towards unrealistic goals, and that could be a contributing reason to the depression epidemic ongoing in the United States. *To many people, the American Dream is the dream, but it is the textbook definition of unrealistic expectations. It’s full of unrealistic expectations for fame, wealth, beauty, over-sized personal achievements, and ultimately, perfection.*

We’re encouraged, says Nesse, to believe that we can do anything that we set our hearts to, leading us to try to achieve dreams that are just unrealistic. We don’t pay attention to our skills and abilities, nor do we put our efforts to the goals we are capable of achieving. We’re distracted by extreme dreams–even when our evolutionary mechanism (depression) kicks in, signaling our ill-fated efforts.

Games, however, can help us escape this depressive loop. Games give us a good reason to be optimistic. Well-designed games deliver a steady stream of achievable goals (they are designed for you to win, after all), and playing games can help us *realistically* believe in our chances for success.

Learning this, it’s no surprise that [70 percent of high-level executives](http://tregamer.wordpress.com/2013/05/26/good-stress-bad-stress-and-video-games/), including chief executive officers, chief financial officers, and presidents, revealed that they regularly play video games while at work for an average of fifteen minutes to an hour. **It’s no doubt, moderate gaming helps reduce stress and makes us feel more optimistic, confident, and motivated.**

If you get stressed out working towards your goals, try playing a game for an hour. Even better, play with a friend. (Personally, my current guilty pleasure is Super Mario Brothers for the Wii.)

Playing games can help alleviate moderate stress, but even more importantly:

> Avoid falling victim to blind optimism and depression by making sure to get constant and honest feedback from knowledgeable mentors. Oftentimes, the feedback that hurts the most is the feedback that you need to hear the most.

Just because you set a goal, doesn’t mean you have to achieve it no matter what. If you learn that the goal you set just doesn’t feel right or isn’t right for you, then don’t hesitate to tweak it or to drop it entirely. It’s your life, and you’re the one behind the wheel. Avoid becoming your own worst teacher, endlessly handing out dreadful assignments and impossible to please. Let your goals evolve with you.

### Final Thoughts
