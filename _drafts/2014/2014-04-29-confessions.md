In two weeks I will turn nineteen years old. I still live with my parents.

I constantly worry that I won’t “make it.”

I’ve been on the conveyor belt that everyone is on. Public school → college → job, except that… that last part is a grey area. Today many millennials are discovering the hard way that a college degree doesn’t inherently [guarantee a job](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/04/53-of-recent-college-grads-are-jobless-or-underemployed-how/256237/).

But we still sign up for college, and sign up for the debt, because college is the goal we have been working towards our entire young lives. What’s the alternative, we are taught? Being homeless?<!--more-->

### Learning has never been cheaper, and yet, getting a college degree has never been more expensive.

Thanks to the internet we are surrounded with free information. Learning has never been cheaper, and yet getting a college degree has never been more expensive? This doesn’t just not make sense–it’s a problem.

Not only that, but accumulating mass amounts of debt, when your goal is to become financially independent, is [counter-productive](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/c-cryn-johannsen/student-loan-debt-suicides_b_1638972.html).

So I made a radical decision. To stop taking classes, at least temporarily to figure things out. And then eventually permanently when I realized the opportunities that college offered weren’t for me. I am now officially a “college dropout.”

The confession I have, is that I have been taking this blog too seriously. Too professionally. I have learned a great deal on my gap year, but I have been too scared to share it the “wrong” way. Which, as I write this, I realize is ridiculous.

It’s easy to get caught up in things that don’t matter, like timing. I was waiting for that “perfect timing” that doesn’t exist, and if I let myself, I would’ve waited forever and a day.

In getting caught up in planning, I’ve been hoarding helpful advice. For this, I apologize.

No longer will I hoard ideas and advice. When I learn something helpful, I will share it. No more games in the middle.

## How to Talk to Parents

When talking to parents about college it’s easy to get emotional. They just want what’s best for you, even if they aren’t sure what that “best” is.

The progression from childhood, to adolescence, to adulthood, is getting more complicated. Now there are new terms in the picture.

- [Emerging Adulthood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_adulthood_and_early_adulthood): a phase of the life span between adolescence and full-fledged adulthood. It’s the period between 18 and 25 years of age where adolescents become more independent and explore various life possibilities. Emerging adulthood is a new demographic, is contentiously changing, and some believe that twenty-somethings have always struggled with “identity exploration, instability, self-focus, and feeling in-between.”
- [Quarter-life crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-life_crisis): a period of life usually ranging from the late teens to the early thirties, in which a person begins to feel doubtful about their own lives, brought on by the stress of becoming an adult. 

My parents don’t understand why I don’t go back to college and just finish my last two years of school so that I would have a career to “fall back on.”

To that, I say I shouldn’t–no–can’t go back. When you come to a fork in the road you cannot pursue both paths at once. Even if you do decide to have multiple plans, Plan A and Plan B, pursuing both at the same time does neither justice.

In fact, looking at root of the  word “decide” itself, it’s “cide,” which means “to cut or kill.” So to make a decision literally means to cut or kill off possibilities.

My reasoning for cutting or killing off my possibility of going back to college:

- The people I admire the most (artists and entrepreneurs) either didn’t attend college, or don’t attribute college to their personal happiness and success.
- Even if I went back and graduated, I would be right back where I am today, left to figure things out in the real world, except two years older and in debt.

My advice when talking to parents about college is to remove emotions from the conversation. It can be easy to get choked up when facing the high expectations of deciding your entire life’s path on a dime. Speak facts. Show them these [keynotes](LINK NEEDED) so they understand where you are coming from. Expand upon your goal of being happy and becoming financially independent. Explore if college can help get you there or not.

If you are unsure, don’t feel pressured to jump into college just because everyone else is. A gap year is always an option, and you can always go back to college if you need to.
