TOC

- Shaman. Have an open mind.
- Watch loved ones distinigrate in front of me. first name basis with those at the ER
- YOUR BODY IS NOT THE ENEMY. healing vs illness. this isn't happening to you for no reason. Must believe that you can learn and can better from this, otherwise you're dead in the water.
- Placebo Effect - healing power
- Mind-body connection. body fat. Cart before the horse.
- Emotional wounds = disharmony. Dicordant frequencies. cannot simply think positively. Easy to avoid. To stop feeling emotions is to feel death.
- Subjective. Problem of medicine to remove all subjectivity. There is no healing without subjectivity. sore throat experience. same ailment can be caused by different things
- Metaphysical: beyond-physical. emotional. energetic. heal emotionally then physical healing follows. doctors don't understand this. Victims of circumstance, of our genes and family illnesses. I reject this. What we inherit are predispositions for illnesses, but what truly activates those illnesses if it we inherit the thought-patterns as well. Metaphysical anatomy. (image?)
- Self-Intuitive Healing Process. my cold mucus example
- Frustrated Healer. LISTEN: YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT.
- Secret to healing. You can't save anybody and nobody can save you. Empowerment = only medicine. Claim your divinity. Reclaim your mind-body connection. Change your fate. Beautiful transformative process.
- ? How you feel effects what you eat. What you eat effects how you feel.


Discordant vibration [see index card] gets stuck and finds physical form in an expression of pain that most closely matches it's pain
discordant frequencies manifest in the body
echoing (FIND INDEX CARD)
The imbalance, the illness, likely occured as an adaptation to a specific emotional trauma, a painful memory, and subsequent reoccuring negative thoughts. These play on a neverending loop, interrupting the harmony in the body. 

What is blocking the natural flow and causing dis-ease is unresolved emotional wounds.

MUSIC
HARMONY
BALANCE
atonal frequencies
Bad note, played out of tune.

Mystery
Illness happens for no reason
Doctors can't explain why people can receive the same treatments for the same problems, while some recover while others don't.
What happens is that those who make radical recoveries, just so happened to deal with the underlying emotional problems that was causing their physical ailment

#### LISTEN: YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT

Placebo effect
But still, this is not as simple as "thinking positively." You can't run away from your pain. Trying to do so will only make it manifest in more violent ways. Illness is your body's way of trying to communicate with you. What do you do when you're talking to somebody and feel like they aren't listening: they yell. This is exactly what your body does. 

For example: Feeling __ gives you a stomachache. You take medicine for it, but don't deal with the underlying emotional wounds. Your body then escalates the message: you get ulcers. You get treatments, but continue to ignore the underlying emotions. 


#### YOUR BODY IS NOT THE ENEMY.

To the contrary, your body is trying to tell you something very important.

It is no secret that there is a strong body-mind connection that effects everything from our mood, hormone production, and energy levels.

health = balance, energy flow
illness = lack of balance, energy blocked

love yourself
be gentle with your healing process. It can be slow to find the answers you seek. Be patient with yourself.


Who we are is determined by our actions, which are determined by our beliefs, determined by our thoughts and emotions.

"If someone wishes for good health, one must first ask oneself is he is ready to do away with the reasons for his illness. Only then is it possible to help him." --Hippocrates

There is no magic elixir.
There is no miracle cure in any form of healing. Lifestyle changes accompanied with a shift in counsciousness are required for any lasting change. 

Healers don't have the power to take away darkness permanently. We can help in the shirt-term, but long-term results depend on what you think, how you feel, and what you do.
We happily asisst you, but ultimately you are the one who is doing the healing. And that is both the hardest and most rewarding work you will ever do.

"The moment you change your perception, is the moment you rewrite the chemistry in your body." -- Bruce Lipton
