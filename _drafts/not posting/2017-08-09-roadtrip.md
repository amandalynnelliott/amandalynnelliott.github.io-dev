Make the Future

+

After roadtripping across the country, hopping between gas stations, catching many a landmark in between vast open spaces and animal crossings, I have to say this trip filled me with so much inspiration that I'll be dripping from it for years to come. 

Dante did an excellent job jam-packing this 7-8 day trip full of things we both wanted to experience, including my list: 

- unfamiliar natural terrain, hikes, and National Parks
- architecture
- sacred sites 
- sustainable living/ intentional communities

I was on the fence about planning the trip at first--it seemed less spontaneous--but later realized that a lot of things stand to be missed out on if you're just relying on what pops up on the road. It would be shame to find out a spot that you would've loved to visit would've meant a short detour, but instead you blasted on past it. 

So planning we (mostly Dante) did! 

## Self-reliance 

As I'm embarking independent life, a big theme for me is self-reliance. Before the roadtrip I had to handle my first flat tire while 50 miles away from home. This was good preparation for soon I was in Utah, 80 miles out before the next gas station, in a dead zone, watching my supply of gas, water, and food like a hawk. 

Not to mention when we made it to the Rocky Mountains, zipping downhill and around sheer rocky cliff-faces with more than 100ft drops, wondering how semi-trucks drive this every day... wondering how people drive these roads in rain, snow, or when the road is covered with ice... 

It's nice to know I've driven the kinds of roads consistently featured in car commercials.

Taking a roadtrip is a crash course in building confidence. When cell service is dead, it's a crash course in learning how to read maps. When you don't want to fork over the dough for another hotel, it's a course in sleeping at a rest area in a tight tiny car packed to the brim with all of your belongings. It's a course in reading people, judging what areas feel safe or not. 

In the process of gaining self-confidence, it's also about recognizing your limits for the sake of safety. Besides the obvious advice to not drive too tired, it also means letting the person with the experience of having terrified deer bolt out in the road take the wheel, especially after you've just passed two cars broke down, each having met deer on bad terms, stopped dead, in the dead of night.

It's about trusting your roadtrip partner to swerve, swerve, and swerve again, or even trusting yourself that if you do happen to hit a deer, everything will be okay. You can always handle the situation and move forward. We human beings are a resilient lot. 

I knew this trip was going to be fun, but I didn't at all expect to be as scared as I was peering over cliff-faces, watching for fallen rocks as we came around corners, and scanning the sides of roads for the reflective eyes of anxious deer. This kind of vigilance isn't needed driving in flat and sunny Florida where's it's uneventful and predictably safe. These new experiences gave me a crash course in not crashing.   

Animals spotted 

- Louisiana bayous: 15ft alligator roadkill
- Colorado: rabbit, deer, antelope crossing at night, nearly hitting the car. A couple cars broke down by us.
- Wyoming: prairie dogs sticking their heads out of burrows for as far as the eye can see
- Yellowstone National Park: bison and elk lazily crossing in front of car
- Grand Tetons National Park: horseback riding
- Columbia River Gorge's Bonneville Hatchery and __ Dam: 10ft long sturgeon (giant bottom-feeding fish), salmon, and the notoriously evil-looking lamprey


Trips challenge you to grow. They challenge the relationship you have with your trip partner. Communication is key: You can't very well drive for a week in silence, now can you?


### New Orleans

We made a quick stop in New Orleans, a predominant tourist area that has the infrastructure for a bustling Mardi Gras, but seems very empty in the off-season. There's a substantial homeless community outside of St. Paul(?)'s Cathedral.

However, the food at vegan restaurant __ was so good, my every bite punctuated with "oh my gosh," that I almost called the trip off just to live in the kitchen. 


### Texas

I can't say much about Texas, we blew right through it. But it was startling passing a billboard that said REPENT in all caps. 
 

### New Mexico

Theme of the Land of Enchantment for me was sustainability. 

After an early morning of driving through a gorgeous national forest and then sleeping at a Walmart parking, we arrived Taos Pueblo, Native American reservation and sustainable community.

Most Native American tribes, especially the ones that carried tipis, were reckless with local resources. They moved around frequently out of necessity, exhausting an area's resources within a few days. 

The Pueblos, on the other hand, were stationary, living in sun-baked mud houses halfway in the ground, providing a cooling effect. These were structures that the first European settlers mistook for giant African termites.

It's an understandable mistake.

The Taos Pueblos settled by a river that they drink from to this day and use to water crops. They have sellers offering a variety of artwork and other handmade goods. 


In heading out, shortly after passing the Rio Grande, I saw strange but beautiful structures. A sign called them Earthships, and I happily dismissed it as a cult.

But these structures, made out of upcycled materials, embody sustainability to its core, with self heating and cooling systems, and many of them growing their own food. They are the brain child of Michael Reynolds, a __ living in New Mexico. 

#### Sustainability 

It's become a dream of mine to live sustainably, own land, design my own home and living systems. It's a practice I foresee adding fulfillment for many years to come. 

I'm taking baby steps now, learning a ton from Pinterest of all places. See my Homesteading board. 


### Colorado

The cliff-abundant drive through Colorado was stressful, but allowed me to have an epiphany for something I've felt like I've always struggled with. 

The past few years, challenging myself to create interesting settings and backgrounds for characters in illustration and animation, I've always felt like my environments felt flat. 

It wasn't until I experienced some real mountains that I realized why: My pictures were always flat because I've grown up in Florida. It's all I've known!

Experiencing mountains made me realize that they are more than a backdrop, it's a change in vantage point. Mountains, whether you are on top of one or in a valley surrounded by them, allows you to see so much more of the land and surrounding buildings than you otherwise would be able to if the terrain was flattened.

### Mount Rushmore

At tourist attractions everybody tries to get the one postcard picture of the monument--it's a rare site where hundreds of people, all acting independently of one-another, are all doing the same thing--it itself is an attraction. 

So while everyone was photographing the faces carved in stone __ of years ago, the perfect picture of which has been captured many times over, I decided to take pictures... of people taking pictures.

Studying architecture built into a mountain, the changing in vantage points, and crowded places, all helps my setting design.

Before taking a trip, stalk up on entertaining audio. We were kept laughing and having lots of thought provoking conversation from the comedy music genre, specifically [Tim Minchin]() and [Garfunkle and Oats]().
