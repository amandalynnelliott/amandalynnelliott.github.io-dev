Post - Corona Connection A Changing World

[Video]
Note: In the video I mention how Corona is an effect just before __ connects. The effect I refer to is called corona discharge which leads to a visible electron avalanche that can be seen as a small spark or even a lightning strike. __

It is as if we have been shaken out of a workaholic-crazed stupor. As if in the middle of rush hour traffic, cars bumper to bumper, somebody opens your car door, yanks you out, slaps you, and says "What the heck are you doing?!"

Except this is happening to everyone, globally, at the same time. 

This unsettling time is like the dark night of the soul; an unwelcome reminder of our mortality and the consequences of our actions. Often I would have this powerless anxious panic rise within me, and I would ask "Why?" Why do we go on with activities that systematically exploit others and the planet? Why do we carry on business as usual? Why?

Now, amid this pandemic, the social distancing and quarantines, our habits are broken, and we are finally able to reflect. The world as we know it, our relationship to it, to each other, and to ourselves, we are realizing, is all more interconnected than we ever could have imagined. 

Now we are able to reflect on the changes that society is undergoing. Many of these changes seem obvious and like they should have happened a long time ago. The world will not be the same, and we will likely see the impact of this for years to come. 

Rather than giving into fear, let's lean into the uncertainty as a time to clarify what we want. What kind of world do you want to live in? 

Here is a compliation of some of the current and potential changes facing the US:

Work
Education
Economy
Resources & Exploitation
- Agriculture
- Energy 
Creativity 

+

Education 
- Public school 
---- inefficient 
---- test prep
---- daycare while parents go to work
---- partial homeschooling, online classes
---- cheaper and less stressful 
- College 
---- classes went to online, linked to Khan Academy  videos 
---- cheaper 
---- don't need to commute everyday 
---- don't need to eat on campus everyday 
---- why do professors teach by repeating the same lecture multiple times a day? Students only ask questions about less than 10% of the time. (At least in my, more introductory classes.) Speaking as somebody who may become a college professor, repeating lectures doesn't seem enjoyable to me. But then again, it may be an avenue to refine the material, altering it a bit each time. 
---- not all online, but more online

Work
- work from home was always a potential, and now it is a reality. The cultural realization that we don't need managers breathing down our necks in order to get work done. Paid sick leave. Power shifting.
- our priorities have shifted highlighting harshly the work that is essential and non-essential. Many minimum wage jobs are considered essential ___
- The necessary end of "the grind" being idlized. Of habit perfection. Success being a goal post on the horizon that is never reached. Workaholism to fill a void. An unquenchable desire for more that is never satisfied. Corona may be teaching us "enough." What it means to have enough. What it means to work enough. What it means to be enough. 

Economy
- This pandemic is also highlighting the American perspective that, if you are poor, you did something wrong. It is a more secular expansion on the ___ (Christian) belief that poverty must be the result of a sinful life, because God wouldn't be punishing you if you didn't do anything wrong. 
Basically, if you suffer, it's because you did something to deserve it. 
Whereas previously, the transgression was moral, today the sin is of not working hard "enough." This "enough" is not defined but seems like a bottomless well for self-punishment and the systematic justification for greed. 
This mindset___ need 3 months savings, a completely unrealistic expectation, when many large companies don't have similar savings.
Well, now the unemployment rate is __
Stimulus like forgiving student debt and universal basic income, are being discussed. With respect to our economy and how it affects the lower and middle classes, do we see governments as the solution, the problem, or something in the middle? 
- It's an idea as old as imperialism. Find a land with resources, and enslave the native population to harvest or mine the resource for you. 
- We know that this economy rewards exploitative practices, of the environment, of workers (better yet, workers in other countries who have less rights and communal power), and how do we stop this? Our economy values efficiency over ethics. How do we create an ethical economy?

Supply and demand
Marketing
Creating demand and providing supply
If the production of a product I desire adds to the suffering of the world, I don't want clever rich people getting me the thing that I desire through unethical but efficient means, so can happily and ignorantly and pay for the product. The product sells well, but there is no information attached to it. 
Can we continue to separate the product from the ethics (or lackthereof) that went into it?
If the only way to get something is by harming others, maybe it is the opportunity to learn how to get by without.

Environmental exploitation 
Social exploitation
Crony capitalism 
Corrupt governments

How do we crack down on the exploitation of the environment and vulnerable individuals? How do we crack down when the exploiters are companies? How do we crack down when the exploiters are governments? 
How do we structure our institutions and organizations to work for us instead of against us?

Corporations and governments are so ensnared, I have a hard time telling them apart at times. 

Governments
- It seems like after __ years of political polarity and grid-lock, our parties and leaders will finally start working together, to compromise, to enact change rather than defending a broken status quo. Our systems are in desperate need of reform. 
- The House and Senate will likely be forced to use teleconferencing just like everybody else. This would mean that, without as many politicians congregating in one area, then there is less of an opportunity for lobbying. We can start untangling our governments and corporations from each other. I'm tired of hearing stories of [insert corporation name] lobbying to get legislation passed that leads ro [insert environmentally exploitative result]. It needs to stop. Is government the right tool to stop it?
- This could result in more, smaller governments. 1 House represents ___ people, more than the founders 33,000. This could result in a deconcentration of power. 
- Election day. If voting goes online and becomes more localized, participation would increase. 


Resources
We are realizing that resources are precious and not unlimited. Abundance seems infinite as long as grocery store shelves are always fully stocked. 

We need to treat somebody who taints resources with unethical or polluting practices, the same way you treat someone pissing in a public pool. 

Agriculture 
Rotten, the Third Plate 
- More local farms 
- stronger local supply chains. Considering the "mileage" put on the food we eat.
- no pesticides and fertilizers 
- no monocultures
Have to pay attention to soil health and microorganisms. Sustainable practices are more time-consuming in the short term, but pay for themselves in the long term by producing crops that are more resilient to disease and pests, more nutricious, and better tasting. 
- ethical treatment of animals 
It is outlawed to record what goes on inside slaughterhouses. 

Energy 
- With less commuting, the carbon footprint goes down, and we are able to have a serious reflection on the state of energy in the world. 
- Hard to visualize the impact of our energy consumption using units like "carbon footprint" and "watts" so I will break it down. 
- [WL] demonstration shows how hard it is to convert mechanical energy (using a pump) into electrical energy. 
- How much energy I use __ equivalent to __ working slaves. It's a lot. [Walter Lewin]
- fossil fuels
- gas 
- renewable 
Is our level of efficiency and growing demand possible for the planet to sustain? 
First world standard of living, doable for a planet? If our standard of living is not possible without systematic exploitation, perhaps we need to reconsider it. 
It seems we are at a precipace if we will be address this energy crisis proactively, with research and innovation, or reactively with war. 

Healthcare
- Many doctor visits will go online. 

Creativity
- Artists, actors, filmmakers, performance artists, models, dancers, are suffering financially. 
- Meanwhile, overall, in isolation, many with less work stress, people seem to be more creative than ever. Rather than getting out of our comfort zones by going to exotic locations and restaurants, people are getting out of their comfort zones creatively. Many are creating content and sharing video for the first time. The video above was my first video, though, I've wanted to get into the medium for years. 
- Similarly, with more people making videos for the first time, like myself and my college professors, I foresee a rise in body positivity. So much of the content we see about how a person should look, are of photoshopped photos, of people who work on their bodies as a full time job... Tens of thousands of dollars in plastic surgeries and enhancements... With more everyday people sharing content, we get to feel like maybe all of our "flaws" are features that they are very things that make us uniquely beautiful.
How can you break out of your comfort zone? What gifts do you have to share with the world?

Science 
- Increased trust in experts. Less distortion of information for political agendas. Having more experts holding political positions. 
- As an individual entering the sciences, it is important to understand the rigor that goes into research. "Science" doesn't say anything, scientists do, and scientists constantly disagree. Research is subject to peer review, and any discoveries that aren't repeatable are discarded. It is a long, but reliable, process. 
Understanding nature and her laws is a work in progress. Yes, in our modern world we exhibit considerable mastery of the material world, but don't be fooled. We are no where near close to building an artificial machine with the kind of sophistication that organic life demonstrates everyday--of cellular growth and regeneration. You want to know what the most sophisticated machine today is? You. You're wearing it. 
Place trust in experts, but never a blind trust. Not all experts are created equal, and they can just as easily be the victims or perpetrators of exploitation.

Travel
[Flights in the air]
- Might want to travel less. 

Religion/Spirituality 
- Increased meaning, purpose 
- Increase in generosity
- holidays online 
- Online group meditations 

View from space, Earth 
[GIF - dust storm from Africa blows over the Atlantic, falls in the Amazon delivers nutrients]

There are two narratives playing out right now. One of fear and collapse, and one of hope and rebuilding. Which one unfolds will depend upon how proactive we were now.

I implore you to use your imagination. What does a sustainable home look like? What about a sustainable town, a sustainable country, and finally, a sustainable planet, look like? What do you envision?

Rather than putting out fires, let's prevent fires. [What caused Australia's fires]

We are facing many challenges, and no single person, company, or institution will have all the answers. And they aren't supposed to.  

Alone we are weak.

No longer.

Behold, the rise of the communities. 

"When 'I' is replaced with 'we' even illness becomes wellness."
