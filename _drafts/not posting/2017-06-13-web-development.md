In my original [Making this Website]({{site.url}}/blog/2017/02/making-website/) post, I said the site took two months to complete. 

Boy, was I optimistic. 

Wrong! 

</br>
Web development is anything but punctual, but I've also realized that the site will never truly be *done*. It's in constant evolution, adapting to my vision, and challenging me to grow along with it. 

This post captures some of this learning that's been taking place.<!--more-->

### Don't Recreate the Wheel

The following is a lesson that my development partner, Davis, helped me realize.

Web development with all of it's interactive and moving parts is much less intimidating when building on existing tools. Popular tools here include the the [Boostrap CSS Framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) for mobile-first websites, and [Angular](https://angular.io/), the powerful development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications, . 

A thorough understanding of what these technologies do is not needed in order use them. To the contrary, the value provided by these tools is that you can engage in higher level thinking *without* having to get your hands dirty. Luckily you don't have to get all greased up, becoming a certified mechanic, before being able to drive your first car. 

These web tools are like black boxes that you can stand on and build on top of. Even though their contents are a mystery, they help you reach great heights. 

This concept of building on existing tools is common sense, right? Not so common, actually. 

Before making this site, I struggled with my ego wanting to understand every complexity of how web browsers (ie: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome) work... The logic goes that if I understand how the tools work, then I can better use the tools. 

It seems reasonable enough.

But consider how redundant it is for an artist to believe that he needs to learn how brushes and canvases are made before ever making a painting. This mindset is a trap that keeps us from creating anything. 

This trap of feeling like all wheels must be recreated before using them is surprisingly common. It has to do with schooling. 

#### We interrupt this program for a rant on education.

Schooling is all about reinventing wheels.

Instead of treating tools as black boxes to build on top of, and content within them as unnecessary trivia... school makes knowing the content as a requirement. To study and test is to memorize what is in these black boxes.  

This is where we learn to fear failure and play it safe by perpetually dabbling in the safety of theoretical knowledge. Rediscovering the contents in black boxes isn't treading new ground, and so, can be tested, graded, or measured quickly and efficiently. It also doesn't make you stick out from the crowd, and so can't be punished. 

Discovering *new* value to add to the world isn't rewarded because the value is harder to calculate. Multiple choice tests can't do it.  

School is all about following in pre-approved footsteps: rediscovering the content of black boxes, and recreating wheels. Like all of school's unquestioned traditions, this one is counter-productive to how people learn. 

> If boredom is present, learning is not. The two feelings cannot occupy the same space. 

We are most engaged when taking risks and exploring new terrain. For proof, look no further than the booming video game industry. Being the pioneer or the hero is an exciting challenge we readily pay for the experience to have. 

Going in circles to recreate wheels is not exciting. Round and round you go, expending a lot of effort, but the lack of geographical progress towards a meaningful goal on the horizon will eat away at your soul. 

Rather than believing the lie school feeds us that we must first become specialists, knowing everything, before creating anything, we should instead accept how knowing everything is impossible. Don't let any lie keep you from creating. Create now, and create all the time. Look at  how children know the least, and yet create the most.

Increased knowledge should increase the sophistication of our creations, not stall the creation process entirely. Perpetually studying is an enticing distraction. It gives you the illusion of progress without you having to risk anything. 

Find some black boxes to climb on top of. When the risk of falling is present, so is learning. 

Contained in the spaces of time when we are at risk of falling is where you find learning. Contained in the black boxes under your feet are tools that may aid your ascent

The more complex our tools become, the larger and more specialized our teams become. We relied on teamwork to get man to the moon, to build smartphones

Stagnation is death. Why is it the goal?

### Existing Tools Used

Here's a list of wheels that we thankfully didn't recreate. 

- [Minima]() is the bare-bones starting theme we used. It served as a guide on showing us the good practices with the static site generator, and it served as a launchpad from where we were able to adapt it heavily to our my purposes. 
- [Magnific pop-up]() added the functionality of enlarging images when clicked and let's me to add image galleries where I want. 
- [Jekyll paginate]() and [Jekyll paginate categories]()plugins so the home and search results pages show a few blog posts per multiple pages, rather than listing them all in a single page that is laggy and infinitely scrolling.
- [Lunr.js]() for search functionality. I'm so relieved this already existed!

### Dramatic Design Improvements


Haphazard numbering

It's all about the grid and having every element multiples of smaller measurements.

Thank you math!

### Teamwork

We've been a great team

Davis better at organization - I postpone that until the end so I'm free to create. He's the opposite, often getting paralyzed and being unable to create until he determined the ideal standards to create in. Programmer, masculine mindset.

His programming 
gives me perspective.

This also has to do with the useful concept of masculine and feminine energy that will be featured in an upcoming series. 



There is something exciting and magical about consistently pouring your energy into a project. You lay one brick down, and then another, and once you take a moment to look up from bricklaying, you discover you're now hundreds of feet from the ground, standing on the scaffolding of a functioning building. The product of hundreds of hours of work changes the context of the first brick laid down, just as much as it changes you. 

As a welder, my grandfather did this work.

Then the project becomes a living thing. The building starts to inhabit people


I am happy to pour myself into this website. This is where I diligently document my progress on projects, growth in a number of skills, and insights from researching a wide variety of topics.
