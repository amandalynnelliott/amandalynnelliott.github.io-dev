Today's Food- add

Have you ever seen an overweight wild animal? An obese tiger, a chubby raccoon? 
No, because animals eat on instinct. 

There's nothing instinctual about the human desire to eat meat and dairy. It may be "normal," but it isn't natural. 

If eating meat was natural, as a child seeing a puppy for the first time, you would start salivating, until you eventually... lundged to rip it's throat out with your teeth... Can you honestly say that your desire in regards to animals are truly aligned with that of a predator's?

In my experience, humans don't want to eat animals alive, but want to cuddle with them. Keeping pets is an extension of this compassion that we feel for all life.

But for some reason, pets are animals that are forbidden to eat, while cows, chickens, and pigs are on the menu? Why?

My primary decision to stop eating meat, besides the alarming evidence labeling it a carcinagen, is that I personally would be unable to kill an animal for food. It would break my heart, and so, I don't feel entitled to eating any dead animal.


Is there anything instinctual about eating dairy? Next time you see a cow, are you going to run up to it, put your mouth on it's teet, and gulp down it's milk...? (You're welcome for that lovely visual!)


The Western diet is addicted to fats. Animal fats in the form of dairy, meat, eggs, and butter, first and foremost. Then vegetable refined fats like oils and things fried in oil, a close second. 
[Chart comparing fat calorie ratio of different foods]
Not only is fat empty calories--a high amount of calories for little nutritients--but the combination of fats and sugar, or fats and salt, make it highly addictive. It's what makes it hard to eat in moderation, and so you overeat, but what you are overeating is already higher in calories and low in nutrients... See how it's a vicious cycle? You put on weight, and yet feel starved of health. 

Salt and sugar are the scapegoats of the Western diet.

The fat you eat is the fat you wear. 
Cutting down on fat, can't eliminate it entirely, gave me a lot more energy. Fat-free vegan.

Fat vegan
In Seattle. Processed foods. Gaining weight. Vegan restaurants. 
Happy for the transition to reducing fats, fat-free vegan, while transitioning to raw vegan. Right now, I eat 50% raw fruits and vegetables, with the goal to increase that to 70%.


Consitpated customers
I recently started working at a restaurant, and it's been fascinating comparing the what people eat with their health, body type, and mood.
Something I notice with customers who only order meat and cheese, none of the veggies: they are emotionally disconnected. It's like their emotions are clogged up. It seems like they are always in a bad mood and getting into disagreements with the loved ones that are accompanying them, and more so than not, thet ones that are the most impatient and are more likely to complain about service. They don't smile as much, and seem so much crankier than other customers... probably because they are constipated.


Health is a transition
Never cold turkey or challenges


Going vegan just so happens to be the single best thing any individual can do for the environment. 

Environment saver checklist
The best way to combat the devastation on our oceans, the dwindling fish populations effecting the food web all the way to our lovely dolphins and whales, is to stop unsustainably eating fish. Done.
Global warming, methane glass, check. 



Today's food is like cigarettes, because similar to our eating habits, smoking isn't natural: it's something you get trained to do, through advertising, lack of stress management, 


Passing the threshold where it's easier to eat healthy than not. 
At first, frustration. Couldn't enjoy fruit and vegetables flavors on their own. Missed the fats. But once I weaned off, I realized how much lighter I felt, how much more energy I had. My "normal" routine of stomachaches, bloating, and lethargy, virtually disappeared. Now I know that if eating something makes me feel heavy and sick to my stomach, then that's something that doesn't belong in my body. Food is fuel, but we've been filling up on sludge.

Today's food would not be like cigarettes without the food industry to back it up. Similar to the cigarette industry, it trains you out of your instincts for the sake of profit. You are shown glistening images of cheeseburgers, and conditioned to accept this as your fuel. Since going vegan, I don't consider most of what my peers consume to be food at all.
As your health deteriorates, the medical industry gladly takes over.

The food industry's goal is to profit, and so they bank on the addictiveness of fatty processed foods. There is no financial incentive to educate people into the produce section of the grocery store, because addicted customers are returning customers.

The more lethargic our food makes us, the less patience we have to plan our meals or cook at home, and the more we look for quick alternatives.

I've been vegan for two and a half years. Daily B12 vitamin.

Doctor's aren't trained in nutrition. Their expensive education funded by pharmaceutical companies, they are white collar drug dealers. What they deal may be legal, but the profit strategy still depends on powerlessness and addiction. 

Learning proper nutrition despite all of the misinformation blocking one's path, is a gargantuan task. But you either make the investment now, and watch all your health problems start to evaporate, or... Keep doing what you're doing, and know that expensive medical bills and an unpleasant painful death awaits. 

Investing in nutritional habits makes you a source of information for your loved ones and friends too. Don't guilt. 

Since quitting the habit, I've never felt better. 
Vegan is cheaper. 
Better for the environment.
I enjoy food more.
It makes me happy to starve the pharmaceutical and addictive food companies of my money. 

Don't take my word for anything, try it yourself.

Like Cigarettes -- trust doctors and USDA and FDA

Doctors and the government can be trusted to provide unbiased health information, right?

Don't be naive. 

[Rx cigarettes] 
The science was available...
Advertising. "Good for your throat" until __ developed throat cancer. 

USDA - purpose is to PROMOTE agriculture. Widespread factory farming habits. To promote meat peakers and dairy farmers. It's a conflict of interest for them to be providing nutritional information. 

FDA - things will get approved if the food isn't immediately lethal. 

School nutrition is abysmal. 
If schools taught proper nutrition, the medical industry would be a fraction of the size it is today.


Dairy - Got Milk? campaign
Lose calicum. Pee it out.
Downer cows.

Eggs - can't say that it's healthy. False advertising. 

I cannot trust an industry that... mad cow.


Family visiting. Pizza. Upset stomaches all night. "The marina sauce." No. It was the cheese!
