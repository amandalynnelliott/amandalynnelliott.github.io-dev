Updates, insights, goals
- field exploration, but always coming back. "Not good enough yet" Do the one thing
- what creativity is and isn't; let yourself unfold; it's a question not an answer
- planning < logging - overplanned garden
- the beauty of art series. Removes wasted energy "What will I work on?"
- my goals
- creative routine: how to make reliable the unreliable; how to catch consistency; what is better, extreme structure, or waiting for inspiration to strike - yin and yang. Prioritize and schedule what is important to you. Removes wasted energy "When will I work?"

Healed emotions around working, employment, and money. [Thanks Stardew Valley and Peace and Plenty]

The beauty of art series

Digital Comics

Need feedback

Consistency has been my challenge. Self-love. Work to share more.

Self-love journaling
Room to create

Invest in your tools, make it easy to create

Not identifying with any roles.

Not tying self-worth to outcomes... means better able to experiment. More open to feedback.
Need to be detached. Love, not fear and desperation.


Art and money. Objective vs subjective results.

Creation is simply a series of small choices from start to finish. 

Let creations develop as a seed, organically, and always different than you expected. Not perfectionism. Not scripted. Don't strangle it.
Organic process, not mechanical. Grow a seed. Starting a work is a question, not an answer.

Reading – log, research, exploration, goals

Not create and then reward with relaxation, but relax first and then create.

Making creativity a habit – like brushing teeth. Something automatic and not to feel bad about. 




Don't get distracted by planning and reflecting. Do the work.

Use the things you make as the logs itself.
Spending more time documenting things than doing things. Halfway productive adn relaxing. Commit to one or the other. 
The blog needs to be the log. No other logs. (Just exercise) No reflections on creative things. Dangerous to put into a box what you've learned so quickly. 
What you've learned is in your head, you don't need to write it down. Can't declare the learning done too early. 
Years later, looking at the stuff I made, not the logs I wrote.
Distraction work. Meta work. Asking what is means... Don't need to do that. "I thought I'd be better." Does it matter? Wasted time worrying about irrelevant things. Doesn't affect growth.
Over-evaluation: halts the learning and iterative.
Evaluation as part of the creative process. Let my intuition guide me.
Simple but not easy. If you want to get better at a thing, do that thing. Other things tangental don't help you. Meta thoughts. Thinking about it. Work on exactly the thing you want to get better at.
DON'T REFLECT ON ART PIECES ONCE I'VE FINISHED THEM ANYMORE. Documenting the learning in your brain is a waste of time. It's already in your head.
Learning is abstract. Don't need tangible expressions of my learning, except for other creative expressions, like the blog.
Logs aren't made to be consumed by others, and I hardly ever look at them again. Logs aren't a product; no value. Don't do them. Logs don't make the world better.
Leave thoughts in abstract form.
Emotional healing is exhausting all in the spirit of making my work less exhausting.
What to something? Do the thing and only the thing.
Pure flow. Habit of muddying up creativity.
100% of the work on a project is in the project itself. Before was plan, execute, reflect. Don't plan. Don't reflect. Muddied.
Set an intention and only do the thing. Intend to study, then do that. But intend to make from iamgination, but end up studying so you "can" do that -- no. Make original work > studying.
More benefit from making original work than copying. 80/20.
Excessive logging isn't just not productive, it's anti-productive. Better to watch Netflix and relax. 
What would somebody who loved themselves do?
A lot of my habits have not been valuable to my growth. - Asking where I should be. What I should do. Not valuable questions. What do I want to do?
Reason to do art: express yourself. So get better at doing that and only that.
If I'm doing something that feels productive, ask myself, "Am I expressing myself?" If not, then don't do that thing anymore.
The goal is not getting these amazing skills of a master... but to express myself. And over time, I get those skills, but I don't even think about it. Use the skills, don't constantly reflect on them.
Cutting logs cold turkey.
I was trying to engineer my improvement to make it as fast as possible. The less I do that though, the faster I improve.


Mistakes and Hooping

Not improvement > expressing / expressing > improvement - modeling, hooping, writing - Hoop smacks mysself in the face, laugh. Imagine how slow you would improve in hooping if less than half the time was spent hooping, most of time studying hooping, taking notes, feeling horrible. Hooping, figuring it out on my own. The thrill of being on the edge of ability, constantly failing. Patience. Adapt, change.
Gettin a better relationship with making mistakes (not self-worth tied), which is not just the learning part, but also the fun part!
Let myself make mistakes when expressing myself.
Find balance of creating own stuff and studying. Keep the focus on creating my own stuff. Study with intention. INTENTIONS: Express 80/ Study 20.
A project is a snapshot of where you are right now. Finish that before moving on. Don't do stuff in order to finish that project. Can't make it perfect. Let myself make the mistakes that I learn from.
