What I wish I could've told myself as an overweight child in elementary school. 
Bullied. Being forced to play sports with my classmates was a source of humiliation. 

### Temporary Goals and Failures

"Going on a diet."
Any change you make has to be an improvement over the way you feel.

Modeling and eating disorder (photo) Hated food.
Living off of smoothies. Not sustainable changes. 

### Emotion About Your Body

Viseral vs subcutaneous fat

The last 5-10 pounds are vanity pounds. There is a difference between being a healthy weight and being "model-thin." Your body doesn't want to lose those last 10 lbs!

It's easy to focus on what you want to change -> self-loathing.
But be appreciative. 

### Emotion Behind Food

Obesity and incest connection. Body fat as a form of protection. Fear of unwanted sexual advances. 
Underlying reasons for weight challenges

### Emotion Behind Exercise

Exercise may be 20 percent while diet is 80 percent
Focus on what you can do with your body. 

Handstands, flow arts (list).

I love teaching people hula hooping tricks!

Challenge yourself in an enjoyable way. You can gravitate towards forms of exercise depending on your goals. Do you want exercise to be a form of self-expression? Or a way to connect with others, such as through sports, like volleyball? Or would you like exercise to be personal time where you can also listen to audiobooks, like running?

The [time period] saw a battle of nutrition __. Fat became the enemy. Sugar was placed into everything in order to compensate and make food palitable. 
Sugar is an inflammatory

Maximum amount of sugar recommended for each day: 
American Heart Association’s recommendations for sugar intake.
https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/how-much-sugar-is-too-much

Men should consume no more than 9 teaspoons (36 grams or 150 calories) of added sugar per day.
For women, the number is lower: 6 teaspoons (25 grams or 100 calories) per day. 

Consider that one can of soda contains 8 teaspoons (32 grams) of added sugar!  There goes your whole day’s allotment in one drink.

For a while, I was regularly getting smoothies at Tropical Smoothie. Turbinado
Tropical Smoothie has 50 grams of sugar! This is supposed to be a healthy option. Tracking the amount of hidden sugars added to food is very important.
