The Illusion of Life

Now has come the time to detail an animation project I've been working on and off for over a year.

I tend to mention this project in passing, and though I am *far* from completion, I'll use this post series to chronicle the learning that has been happening behind the scenes series. It'll illustrate *what is taking so long*. In progressing forward, I often hit a wall in my understanding, which leads me to going down a detour for months of learning. 

Oh, and did I mention this animation is only going to be minute long? 

Haha, oops.

### Why? 
Big projects can easily become demoralizing when the horizon line of completion gets further and further in the distance. 
I would've long since dropped this project if I haven't been reminding myself why this project is important to me. 

What started a normal get-together with close friend, Stacy, led to intense intellectual discussions for about 14 hours. This day was filled with many, almost spooky, synchronicities. During which, we took a break to work on separate things, and she wrote a poem about a lion and a tamer.

I went home, but I couldn't get the poem out of my head. 

I took the task to animate it, thinking, "It'll probably take a few weeks at most!" 

I had no idea what I was getting into. 

<p class="sidenote">For the sake of leaving the work up to interpretation, I won't reveal the details of the conversation or the poem until after I've made it.</p>

### The Illusion of Life
To my horror, and later excitement, there is no magical "animate a lion running" button. At least none that work and have it come out beautifully. 

I threw together a storyboard and character designs, but to my dismay my designs were flat, my anatomy lacking, and my camera direction was full of ambitious pans that I was nowhere near being able to execute.

The illusion of life is only accomplished through the practiced *knowing* of the nuance of anatomy, acting, movement, timing... There is no guessing. An illusion cannot be accomplished by accident. 

Examples of the details I've been acquainted with: 

- How a sprinting lion's rib cage and pelvis come together to store the potential energy that will be released all at once like a spring.
- How a human walk cycle is broken up into multiple poses: a pose for when the foot makes contact with the ground, a pose for when one foot is passing the other, etc.
- For the walk of a four legged animal, which paw makes contact with the ground first, second, and when.

The kind of animation I am referring to is handdrawn animation. It's the most complex, but also offers the most control. 

My next post will dive into types of animation.

## Types of animation

I am biased towards handdrawn animation, but an exposure to options help before diving in. Every technique 

### Cut-out animation

There's no way to get realistic motion with cut outs, but it's crude style lends itself to some hilarious effects.

This can be dun the old fashioned way with physical paper and a camera. Pieces of photographs, magazines, or your own drawings can be cut apart and manipulated inbetween frames. Monty Python is ripe with fun examples.

Nowadays a lot of software is available that can accomplish the same effect. You can create an entire library of possible mouth shapes for a character, and when the occasion arises, you slap the right one on!

### Stop motion animation

Similarly there is stop motion. Same idea as with cut out, but with 3D models, and usually lots of clay.

### Handdrawn

Beautiful, mastered by the original Disney animators in the 1930s. No need to reinvent the wheel, their work serves as valuable resources. 
Web animation. Made with SVG images, and coded with CSS and Javascript. The same principles of animation apply here, with the added complexity of a user being able to interact with it. For example, the animation can be triggered by a user clicking on it or scrolling down the page. 

### Animation software 
Life as a former pirate.
The first time I saw the show Rick and Morty, I could immediately tell that it was animated in Toon Boom. 
It's simply more convenient than using paper. 
At the same time, I can in no good conscience continue to support companies like Adobe. 
Affinity Designer
I don't edit my photos anymore. The best pictures don't need editing but tell a good story all on their own. 
Open Toonz
Krita 

Hardware
You are going to want a graphing tablet. I still use an older model, Wacom Bamboo Fun.

### The Animation Process
Traditional 
1. Written concept
2. Audio
3. Character designs
4. Storyboard
5. Animatic 
6. Animate
7. Testing and adjustments
8. Backgrounds
9. Color the animations 

This encompasses a multitude of specialities. No wonder it takes an army of artists to produce animated films.


Audio
Editied in free program, Audacity. 

Character designs
A character designed for cut out animation looks different than one designed for handdrawn animation. 
[original]
Figure drawing and studying animation improved this for me rapidly. It's one thing to have an illustrated character look good, but handdrown animation demands and understanding of them from all potentional angles.

Acting classes 
about being confidently vulnerable instead of vulnerably confident. Every action has a guiding purpose, a Why. Slowness, mundane relatability
Hayao Miyazaki is a master at this. 
[video clip]
It's not going from point A to point B, but about what happens inbetween. This is where unique personality is hiding.

Animation resources
- YouTube: AMB Animation, and his downloadable PDF packs. By far the best resource online. I'll likely buy more of his products.
- Animation Reddit
- Animation Podcast
- book: Force, Dynamic Life Drawing for Animator's - before attempting to depict moving life, first learn to capture the humanity in life
- book: Framed Ink - It's hard enough telling a story in multiple frames per second if you struggle with telling a story in a single frame, written by master storyboarder that has worked for Disney films on multiple occasions. 
- book: The Animator's Survival Kit
- book: Anatomy for the Artist
- weekly figure drawing sessions
- YouTube: Jazza 
- Storyboarding the Simpson's Way PDF
- Animation exercises
- Google Chrome extension to leaf through a video frame-by-frame

The only way to learn is to do.

I don't need lots of detail to convey a story. 

Curvillinear perspective?



Delegation
Collaboration document 
character designs and delegation, criteria for working with somebody: they are driven to learn and improve themselves and will handle criticism constructively - will save time rather than make it harder than if I just did it all myself - friends, we "click"..., terms of agreement with priorities (1) happiness and (2) honesty

Rotoscoping. 
I want to work on walk cycles.


Currently working on backgrounds.
