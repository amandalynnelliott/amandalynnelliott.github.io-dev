recent clarity, exploration comes from action, networking, the willingness to adapt, to bring into harmony all parts of yourself

Trust yourself ~ confidence ~ self-love
Trusting authority over yourself. The Devil [Make the Future]

Emotional boundaries
I thought working required me to sacrifice my emotional stability in order to adhere to whatever whims the manager wants. 

Self-trust and self-love are one in the same. 
You violate your trust when you do something you don't want to do, or when you don't do something that do. 
Fragmentation - how to reconcile parts of you that want different things. All parts of you are trying to protect you. 

Clarity comes from action, but not if that action violates your boundary. 
I wouldn't know that I don't enjoy event planning if I hadn't tried it (and failed horribly) multiple times.

My story of unemployment 
Thought it was the repetiveness of it, but that's not it. We all do repetitive work all the time- brushing your teeth, cleaning dishes---- with no quams. 

The problem is the lack of emotional connection. To the contrary, emotions are seen as the enemy, to be managed by those with industrial psychology degrees. The machine, this organization, is always right. 
The customer is always right. This creates so many problems for small businesses. Customers don't treat employees like their human, because in their eyes, they aren't really. Walmart employees aren't people, but part of a larger machine that can't be comprehended. So people yell in the same way they yell at their uncooperative computer. 

A lot of work in the world is repetitive. You make a cup once but wash it 1,000 times. Nursing, selling goods, farming...

The spiritual death many people feel working today is not the result of repetitive work, but the lack of emotional connection. 

I'm relieved that I can work now without inevitably burning out six months in, needing to quit in order to recover, and then resigning to never work again. 

Now in my work search, I pledge to not violate my emotions.

I used to be overweight. 
I realized the dilemma of wanting to eat a dessert. If I ate it, I'd feel guilty if I ate it, but deprived if I didn't. The situation I set up for myself was lose-lose. 

Violating your desires and emotions does not mark you more productive, but less. Try creating anything when you would rather be doing anything else, and it will result in nothing but frustration. 
Nature flows in the path of least resistance. 

Not every adult is right. 

There is no right answer, only your right answer. Be willing to adapt. 

I'd quit in order to leave my perceived emotional abuser, all a while oblivious to the fact that my true abuser was myself. 

World in desperation. Environment. Catastrophic human events that negatively hurt so many are almost never the result of intentional malice, but desperation. 
Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme, lost $__. He was not motivated by "greed," but by a fear of disappointing his investors. 

There are two philosophical paths before us, Plato vs Aristotle. Do you believe that individuals are not to be trusted over sovereign machine and expert reign, or that the safest, happiest society is one which maximizes individual freedom?


Nature flows in the path of least resistance. Microbiology - plant to receive nutrients from microrganisms happens in a mere __s. 
What you want is downstream, not up.
We are all fragmented. Get the different parts of you to agree on a path.
Momentum is held back by contradictory thought. Beliefs.

Mechanical vs Organic view

Priortizing the machine over the humans that make up the machine.

Relaxing is the enemy
Flow blossom quotes
We don't get mad at flower buds for not being fully in bloom yet. We simply stand in wonder at the process taking place.

Relaxing is a necessary part of life, of creativity. 
My writing process requires looking away frequently. Usually I will feel a ding in my head for when it's time to write. Trusting my inutition leads to expoentially more interesting work. I follow my inclination to look up whatever seemingly random topic I am interested in that moment (like microbiology, for example), and the insights from that will connect in many unexpected ways. 
It's easy to get tunnel vision when getting into a routine or pursuing your goals, but stepping away gives you a bird's eye view--an understanding of what is worth, or not worth pursuing, and how to prioritize. 


[De-conditioning flow chart]
What do you want to do?
Do you really want to do this or do you feel like you have to? etc.


Accepting my goal. It's in the distance.
Focusing on the 1% of the work that I'm truly excited about rather than the 99% that would be in demand.

My work takes more time. You won't see me doing daily vlogs or hourly Twitter updates. I am committed to producing high quality work.
