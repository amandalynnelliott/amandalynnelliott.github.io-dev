Refuting the concept of doing free work to build a portfolio
Less stress? Actually much more. 
Young adults largely have to be subsidized by their parents
Brings down the industry as a whole, as well as the self-employed and freelancing community. 

Expectations and timelines too loosely defined
Friend asking for a favor

Money makes the transaction tangible
Still a transaction, but just with intangible things, like ___. It makes it messier and more emotional.
Bargain intangible things, like how much you believe in it, exposure, experience.
- exposure: never works. His friends will also want you to do free work too.
- experience: literally every action you take gives you experience. Shooting yourself in the foot is an experience too.
- hope for wealth: Equity stakes in company's that you have to do the heavy lifting in building

No respect of time
Not paying for time, so they don't know how much you are spending doing it. How hard it is. 
Instead of investing money, it's wasting time, which might as well be the same thing 
This type of client will consistently show up late to meetings.

All you do in doing free work is prove to somebody that you can keep doing something for free.

Redefining expectations later on is messy. 
A lot of times it results in a break up. 
When I've done free work for people, the pattern is clear as day. I will get burned out, ask for payment, at which they will of course decline. And at that point the bridge is burned for me. A professional relationship is terminated. What a waste of investment and time it was for both parties. 
People want to get a finished product for free, but with creative and development work there is no "finished." Goal posts keep moving. Things change after BETA testing. A pseudo-client may have a product to tinker with, but he won't have a team to change and grow the project based on market feedback. 
Founders have a test. They either believe in their idea enough to 1 make it themselves 2 pay others to do it. Funding. Research. People who have an idea that try to find people to do it for free in exchange for the intengible benefits 

Don't take on pseudo-clients unless you want to get paid in pseudo-money too. 

Still not convinced?
Let me deliver the ex-machina.

It's never going to be enough. 
No matter what you do, it won't 

Let there be no hope
Kill hope right away of you working for free. 
Define expectations as soon as possible. 


Getting back into networking after being manipulated. 
People are fascinating. Observe them enough and you can detect patterns.


Plumber analogy
The little things build up, add up

You are a plumber vs a friend

What? Who doesn't want a boss with no benefit of having a boss (money) and with no end of site? Who doesn't want that? 

Tactics will be used to keep you working for free
Guilt
Incentives at some unclear time in the future

Messy. Money makes quitting easier. Refund.

What businesses do you know operate by letting people come in, get this months groceries free with a promise to pay next-months. 
Businesses need money. Cash flow is the life force of business like food is to organisms. Try exercising without eating a meal first, you might pass out. Do this too much and you die. Now run a business without having incoming money. The mission statement you drafted for it might as well be it's obituary. 

"Do you have money problems"
No the reason I'm doing this is to prevent money problems. It's irrelevant.

If you want consistent, reliable progress, it needs to be paid for. People who demand that without paying for it are people not worth working for. Literally. They will not pay you. They will never volunteer to start paying you. 

Self-worth

Quit free work

Slaves don't put in their two weeks; they just run away.


Receive either payment in full, or a retainer--an estimate for time and money needed to  do the exact scope of work detailed by the client. If the scope changes, that is a discussion that also changes the timeline and payment. All of these things are intertwined. 

Work towards getting enough case studies with high enough results so that you can get clients that pay enough AND trust you to work your magic and deliver those results for them.

"Clients don't know what they want"
Incorrect. They want results but don't know how to get them. That's where you come in. 

"Clients are stupid"
"In my experience the way you want to do it hasn't worked, but we can try and test it."


The mistake of valuing the product over the people.
A product is made once. It needs to adapt overtime if it's to stand a chance in the marketplace. People change and grow all the time, and the right team is capable of making ocuntless products. 



A Closer Look at the Dynamic
Leadership
Relationships change all the time. The mistake I see people who want work done for free making is that they don't adapt the expectations of the relationship. They view their job as simply to "re-motivate" the staff. Rather than taking those concerns to heart, they sweep them under the rug and use whatever motivation tactic is likely to work at the time. A lot of times it's excitment ("Don't you want to see this thing made?"), sometimes pride ("Making this a success can be a stepping stone for you to go onto greater things"), and I've even had shame used to motivate me ("What do you think others will think of you if this fails?"). Like putting a baid-aid on a gashing wound, motivating somebody to work on something that they are fundamentally have problems with is a terrible short-term fix. 
They don't acknowledge the feelings of others, probably because they aren't acknowledging their own feelings as well.
Burned out. Demoralized. 
Short-sightedness coming from a place of fear, imidiacy __
It's about being adaptable, working with the flow with your own energy and the energy of others. Even if it means letting a person go. Letting a person go, even if it means a project will take longer to complete, is far preferable to overworking people who believe in you and the vision. What happens is eventually, they don't believe in it anymore, the project doesn't get completed, and far worse, the relationship is lost. It festers a feeling of resentment between both people: for the worker, it's a feeling of self-preservation. For the employer, further evidence of how lazy people are and how hard it is to find good work.

Starting freelance by doing free work is often advised as a way to build confidence, a portfolio, and reputation. I disagree. 
Worst case scenario, you do a horrible job, refund the client back in full. You part ways amicably, and done. Without money as tool of transaction, parting ways becomes much more complicated and personal.

Boundaries
As a young person, feeling like I needed to prove myself
Jobs people hate. Sick. 


Your work needs to come from a good place.
"Forcing" yourself to work when you don't want to results in nothing but frustration. Instead of all of your mental energy focusing on the task before you, your focus becomes divided. Rather than enjoying the process, you criticize the outcome, that of course didn't turn out well, and it never would have been good enough anyway.
Don't divide yourself. Only work when you genuinely want to. Only work with people when you genuinely want to work with them. Working with others because you feel like you "have to" puts you in a place of desperation and gives them control over you. It makes it all the easier for you to let them violate your boundaries over and over again until you snap. 


Accepting that I'm not interested in marketing.
