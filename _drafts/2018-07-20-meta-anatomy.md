Why are you sick
What is Healing



+



High school. Inbetween classes and homework, .
Heart problems, back problems. My mom almost went blind and had three eye surgeries. Cysts. Stomach ulcers. Gallbladder removal surgery... All over the course of my last couple years in high school. 

Either my mom or dad were going to the ER so frequently that we were getting on a first name basis with the nurses there. It gets to the point where you get so incredibly numb. "Mom's going to the ER tonight." "Okay... Are there any leftovers in the fridge?"

I am sick of sickness.

I am tired of seeing people I care about disintigrate in front of my eyes while they stubbornly cling to perspectives and methods that aren't helping. Journey to explore alternative healing methods. I am happy to share my progress...

#### Your body is not the enemy.

The purpose of physical pain is to alert you of a wound that needs your care and attention so it can heal. Why would emotional pain be any different?

Metaphysical anatomy 

There will never be a cure for the common cold because the cure is emotional and unique to the individual. Oftentimes the person just needs to rest, a break from busy life, but unless their body breaks down physically, they don't feel entitled to request that time off. Getting the cold gives them the opportunity to get the rest they need. 

Other times a cause for a cold can be as simple as "Huh, I haven't gotten sick in a while. I forgot what it feels like to be sick." The next day, what do you know--stuffy nose.

Healing Power

The fact that the Placebo Effect exists speaks to the power of the human mind. If a person believes they are going to get better, proper medicine be damned, they do. Naturally, the reverse is true: If a person believes they won't get better, proper medicine be damned, they won't. 

I understand that what I'm asking you to consider may seem absurd: that our emotions directly cause our physical state. But is it really that far fetched to consider when it's an accepted fact that people will stressful lives have higher blood pressure and higher risk for heart problems? Haven't you noticed that people with depression experience health problems more frequently?

Body fat
The evolutionary purpose 
We think that being overweight leads to insecurity, but it is insecure feelings that leads to weight gain. There is an evolutionary benefit to this.
Asking weight "Why are you here?" Afraid of being too thin. 

Frustrated Healer

The first step of healing is the hardest: believing that healing what ails you is possible. Without that, you are dead in the water. Not only will nothing work, but you'll never meet the practitioners who could help because you aren't even looking.

I've run out of sympathy for people who experience a laundry list of chronic medical problems. I am tired of watching my loved ones disintigrate in front of me, full on believing that they are victims of circumstance, all awhile, closed off to alternative empowering perspectives.

It has been a hard lesson for me to learn multiple times that trying to help people who aren't receptive to my help and instead just want to complain and gain sympathy, is wasted energy. I'm done trying to convince people that there is hope when my encouragements fall on deaf ears. 

The benefit of letting go of the need to save those who are sick and yet continue to stubbornly complain, is that I'm free to focus on the people who DO want my help. Who are willing to consider things from a different angle. To consider the possibile reality where they can release what ails them. They've already done the hardest part: They believe.

The precursor to physical healing is emotional healing. It is a simple truth that is difficult for many to embrace, because it means facing the very things they've been running away from.

When you repress your negative emotions long enough, they manfiest physically in the body. Healing your body means that you need to face the very things that you've been avoiding to the point of illness. Hooking you up to machines and IVs, pumping you with meds, and cutting you open to move things around: that's easy. Doing the emotional work is hard.

It's the hardest truth for many to grasp because modern society makes it ridiculously easy to avoid doing the painful work of healing emotional wounds. You can distract yourself with work, with other people's problems, entertainment, and medication, until you drop dead, perferably in a hospital bed that results in an expensive bill.

Release emotional baggage. Traumas. Wounds.

I view my relationships as co-creative experiences. In sharing your life with other, your significant other and close friends, you each give each other new perspectives and advice. All people leave better than when they entered from having grown in tandem.
But this only works with conscious relationships. Relationships chosen subconsciously, out of fear, out of habit, out of a need to save somebody or to be saved, will be nothing but draining. Parties leave these connections typically worse off than when they entered. 
Who you spend time with must be a conscious choice. If you prioritize spending time with somebody who drains you, then you've prioritized their needs over your own. Don't be surprised when you feel your life force slowing slipping away from you.

I'm not saying to forgo modern medical treatment. If you have a broken bone other intense phsycial problem, get it properly tended to, of course. 

But at the same time, understand the beast that you are dealing with. If you blindly trust the medical industry to the point where you give your power to them, then you'll end up like my family: sicker than ever and in neverending medical debt.

//Healthy people doesnâ€™t make money, sick people do. Doctors, hospitals, drug companies, and insurance companies benefit from sickness, and all the financial incentives point towards sickness.
Healthy citizens makes for an unprofitable health industry. 
I love the fact I am depriving pharmaceutical companies, junk food industries, health insurance companies, and many other leaches and pollutants of our health system of their beloved cash.

The medicine industry is not always in the business of curing illness--but in prolonging the life of the sick in many expensive and borderly in-humane ways that make you question the person's quality of life. Do not forget that it is first and foremost a business.

[Austrian philosopher QT]

Teaching people to heal themselves isn't a very lucrative business. It's not as profitable to empower people than keeping them dependent on you. 

Modern medicine isn't in the business of curing illness as much as it is in the business of treating symptoms and subsequent treatment side effects. But if you want to deal with the source, you need to go deeper.

Instead of fighting symptoms, prevent disease in the first place. Educate yourself on nutrition. An educated, healthy, confident nation is harder to govern.

This is the secret to healing.:

*You can't save anybody, and nobody can save you.*
 
Healers don't heal; they hold space for the person to heal themselves. They empower people to trust in their own healing abilities.

Doctors do this in a more physical form, while Shamans in an energy form. While I reject all forms of "medicine" that make the individual feel powerless, I embrace all forms of healing that are safe and empowering, because empowerment isn't just the most potent medicine: it's the only kind of medicine that exists.

example of sore throat and crush
"I want to tell him, but I can't"
"I want to tell him, but I can't"
"I want to tell him, but I can't"
That discord the body interprets as an illness. Something to be called attention to

#### Self-Intuitve Healing Process

Feeling like every part, every cell of my body, is conscious. In science, consciousness is a problem--literally dubbed "The Problem of Consciousness." But when I believe that matter in it's entirety, including the matter that makes up my body, is conscious, then it makes my personal healing process surprisingly straightforward. 

We are matter. Matter is dense energy.

we are our feelings and thoughts in physical form.

Every body part, toe, finger, has an emotion attached to it. Connected to an element. Flow. Lines.

1. What physical part ails you?
2. When did it start?
3. What negative emotions were you experiencing when the problem started, or just before?
4. Look up the potential metaphysical causes of your ailment. (ie: deafness is caused by not listening to your inner voice, stomach problems have to do with worry, lower back pain is connected to feeling burdened financially or __, etc.)
5. Turn inward and ask "Why are you sick?" Don't force an answer. Use your imagination to let answers bubble up to the surface. Let your body speak to you.
6. Let yourself feel, process, and release any pain, any memories, that come up.
7. Ask your ailing body part what it needs from you in order to return to a state of balance. The answer will be uniquely personal to your own emotional wounds and life experiences. Some of the answers I have gotten for myself were: *I need to know that you won't hurt me again by overworking yourself.* / *I need you to commit to me--listening to your emotions--instead of abandoning yourself.* / *I need to know that you won't let others hurt me by staying in toxic relationships.*
8. Write positive affirmation negating the trauma. ie: If the ailment occurred because you were feeling unloved, then repeat affirmation like... *I am lovable. I love myself. I am surrounded by love.*
9. If needed, seek out a medical intuitive or open-minded therapist to help guide you to the answers you need. 
10. Once you feel emotional relief, physical relief will follow.

Personal experience doing this process: mucus. 
You're welcome for that visual! ;-)

The only way out of pain is through it. Face your wounds with courage and love, and they won't fester.

Healing in this way is beautiful and transformative process. It's a process that leaves you feeling even better than before the physical problem presented itself. You feel lighter, and the subsequent lessons your body gave you leads to life changes that aligns you with a more authentic life.

Healing is a journey accelerated by careful attention and self-love.

Subjectivity

Our desire to remove all subjectivity from medicine--to make it a purely objective science of chemicals and tissues--while stripping us of our immense power of self-healing in the process.
Removing all subjectivity from your life is to deny your power--to deny how your perspective and actions directly affect your reality.
