Nature wastes nothing, while we waste almost everything. 

Vertical. We see ourselves as above or below nature. Richeous in taking what we want, or ashamed. 

The solution: see yourself as a PART of nature. 

Gaia: we are on more than a rock. Viewing the planet as a sentient being, an extension of you, is respect, gratitude. 

It can be easy to see the problem of sustainability--what we have done to our oceans, land masses __. It can be easy to see photos of what we have done to our oceans and land masses--miles of almost-permanent plastics and pollution--and get overwhelmed. This problem is so big. What could any one person reasonably do about this issue?

- garden. grow some food, it's really fun! 
- support local growers and farmers markets
- use reusable bags. They are bigger and makes things easier to carry anyways. 
- reusable water bottle - simple!
- go vegan/vegetarian, or have a meatless day of the week. You'll try new foods and save money.
- if you eat meat or dairy, check the practices of your sources
- drive electric, bicycle, or walk. 
- make your own hygiene products out of simple things like baking soda, or buy from environmentally conscious sources. [You don't need to use as much as you think anyways.]()
- make your own cleaning products out of common household products like vinegar, or buy from environmentally conscious sources

Read every label. Ask more questions. What are you putting into your body? What are you drinking? What are you breathing? Your health and Gaia's health are inexorably linked.

Sustainable living and homestead plans
Drove by these strange structures. Thought it was a cult that revolved around aliens...
[Earth ship]
To my surprise, this half-in-ground, beautiful structures, are actually 

Homesteading and off-the-grid living may seem strange, but I'm struggling to find more effective and fulfilling ways to live. It is significantly cheaper. It promises stronger community support. 

Plan to homestead
[garden picture]
[Pinterest board-- lots of ideas]
Walking - improved design. Stop designing for cars, but for people. 
Will write in depth in the future. (Back to Eden gardening method, microbiology camera vs industrial farming) Growing food. Nice getting tomatoes, onions, and cilantro from the garden regularly. 
It doesn't take long to set up, and you simply water it on the days it doesn't rain. 
Eventually I want to learn more homesteading skills, like canning,

### Antibiotics and Pesticides: Fight for the Little Guys

Connection between the human digestive system and the gut flora/ bacteria, and all of the micro-organisms in soil.

Nature is all about biodiversity and a delicate and complex web of transactions always occuring. Energy is always changing form, passing from bacteria, to plant, to animal. (plant answers the call in __ seconds)
Dr. Elaine Igham
Industrial farming, on the other hand, is all about uniformity and chemicals. In over-riding nature's need for diversity, for these transactions to take place, we take away much of the biodiversity and subsequent nutrients needed for plants to thrive and protect themselves against infestations. Many agricultural scientists promote the use of fertilizers and pesticides, which escacerbates the problem, until the soil is eventually barren of life.

In order for life above the soil, you need life below the soil.

Agricultural scientists and the billion dollar chemical industry it supports, promotes the focus on three nutrients: Phosphorus, Nitrogen, and __. 

This is like a doctor telling you that you will no longer eat, and will instead live off of vitamins. He gives you three vitamins. How long do you think you could last on that? 

Nature wastes nothing and recycles everything. In healthy ecosystems, the water that gets filtered through the soil comes out crystal clear. This is not the water that comes from our lawns and our industrial farms.When we pump our food supply, our plants, full of these chemicals, they don't know what to do with the excess, the poisons, the soaps, the overdosing amount of vitamins, the water that comes out is tainted. 

As a species, it is natural for us to look at the cosmos in awe, wondering at how many plants in the universe have water, the fundamental requirement for life. But I can't help but see the red flags when people talk of colonizing other planets. Are we so much of a throwaway culture that we will eventually throw away the planet for a shiny new one? How long before we taint its water supply with our unsustainable habits?

Hormones. Don't take birth control. It releases the hormone at a rate that your body wouldn't naturally. [Link to Plan Life Around Period post]

### Why do we keep outsourcing utilities?

water, electricity, gas, sewer services, trash/recycleing

Why do we subvert the rightful utilities manager, Nature, when the result is more expensive, more wasteful, and less efficient? Nature is the most powerful recycler at our disposal, but we have been forgetting that. 

Nature wastes nothing, but we waste almost everything. 

Communities should reinstate nature as their utility manager. We need to stop outsourcing utilities to large nameless industries, and reclaim our voice and power as the little guys. It is about small-scale efforts. 

Before we can have a sustainable planet, we first need a sustainable home. Then we need a sustainable street, neighborhood, and town. 

Can you imagine an entire town operating sustainably? What would that look like?

Then let's expand that to a sustainable state. A sustainable country. How would they operate? What would it be like to visit as a foreigner? How would you need to adapt?

The exciting thing about this process of building sustainable communities is that it calls for local creative problem solving and gives meaning, purpose, and commodraery to areas where before there was none. We have spent so much energy over the last two centuries trying not to work, especially wholesome work connected to survival needs, completely overlooking that this work is what connects us to each other and a sense of purpose.

If this is done right, the communities that would spawn from these efforts would be as interesting and diverse as we are as people, as the landscapes we live in are. This is not about mass-marketed and one-size-fits-all living situations. Not at all. This is about living in the flow of nature, adapting to the cycles of giving and reusing resources, that we are already surrounded by.


septic tanks [research]. This is what soil lives for. What we call waste, excrement, poop (haha), is food for micro-organisms--a vital part of the food web that we have been ignoring. Why do we design our communities in such a way that we have to pay for the honor of having our waste properly disposed of?

It seems silly to me how we collect and dispose of human waste, an obvious cheap and readily accessible fertilizer. But rather than let Gaia's natural digestive system do it's thing, we dump this waste in overwhelmingly large quantities __ [research] 

Why do we pay for a tap of flouinated and questionable water, and let so much water go to waste, rather than collecting the rain that falls from the sky readily for us to use? 

Why do we pay for electricity, most of which is harnessed by the unsustainable burning of fossil fuels, or the dangerous practice of nuclear power, when so much sunlight falls on our rooftops completely wasted? How many nuclear power plants need to meltdown before we learn that the risk and price of such an energy source is far too high? 

Why do we not design our houses and communities to be better efficient at harnessing the resources of the local area? Why don't we design houses that can have simpler solutions to temperature regulation: directing the flow of air, having a green house on the house to keep it cool? Why don't we use natural insulation in the walls like adobe that can provide warmth?

Nature wastes nothing and recycles everything, We are a part of nature, so we can do that too! It is possible. The first and hardest part is believing that positive change is possible, to have faith. 

I hate to break this to you
Corporations, governments, and large industries don't have incentives to protect the planet. These systems are built on the goal of short-term profits and the bottom line that can always be bigger. Empowering people to grow their own food doesn't raise the bottom line. Empowering people to be conscious consumers doesn't raise the bottom line. Empowering communities to redesign housing and to restore nature as the rightful utilities manager, doesn't increase the bottom line. 

Not to say that there aren't many people, many leaders in various fashions, who do amazing work. I applaud any effort in this area. 

Not to say that there aren't scientists doing making amazing strides in sustainability. I applaud those that dedicate their time in laboratories developing better biodegradable materials and plastic-eating organisms. We need their insights. 

But there comes a time when you need to stop waiting for somebody to save you. 

As a society, we need a huge philosophical shift if we are to rewrite our future from one of calamity, famine, drought, disease, and extinction, to one of sustainable abundance in the sunshine. 

This shift starts with you and it starts with me. And then your family and friends. And then the people they know. 

What do you think? Aren't we a part of nature? If so, let's start acting like it. Let's work together.

The Cost of Efficiency 

Emotional fulfillment. Waste. 
Time of adjustment. Gradual and lasting change today, rather than being shocked and forced into adapting to less than pleasant circumstances in the future. 

Our commercialized society tramples on top of the little guys, not just the micro-organisms that our very existence depends upon, but also you and me. If you aren't a corporation or a government with multiple commas in your bank account, it is easy to feel powerless to this problem before us. But let's be honest, feeling powerless is getting old. 

Many of those in power that promise salvation have chains hidden behind their backs. There is a movement that the answer to our problems lies, not in less industrialization, not in less dehumanizing commercialization, but more. There is an agenda to create a untied force, a government for the entire planet. This will be presented as the only way we can save this sentient rock that we call home. 

But I warn you. This agenda will not lead to what we need, but to more of what has been hurting. With the more power government assumes, the less empowered we are as individuals, as communities, and our humanity, mental and emotional well-being, and planet suffers because of it. 

Salvation lies, not in the continuation of renouncing our power, but in reclaiming it. Stand up for the little guys, first of which being, yourself.

You have the questions, the desire, the will, and everything you could ever need to make positive change here. I'm counting on you, as you are counting on me, as we are counting on everybody else. 

// If you had a penny, that would be nothing. But if every person on the planet had a penny, and that amount was pooled, it would amount to over seventy million dollars. This is the power in numbers.

Together, we're not so little, are we?

Step 
1. believing it is possible. believing you can make a contribution (hardest part)
2. Start with small changes
3. Set goals
4. Connect to community

As a society we have become so obsessed with efficency, both as individuals and as collectives, that we don't take a step back and ask if what we are optimizing are the things that we should be doing in the first place.
