Make the Future

I went to a psychic a while ago. Simply guided by curiosity, I didn't have any specific concerns, but I left with a bad taste in my mouth. 

She didn't say anything explicitly bad, but I walked in expecting a discussion and reflection on life, while what I got were some shallow predictions that did not impress me. 

There's a tendency to view the future as static, fixed, and mostly removed from our control. There's a tendency to view reality with the cold detachment of a scientific researcher: as if everything is random, and again, outside of our control. 

Wow, what a powerless world-view to have. Do *not* sign me up for that one! 

I suppose most people go to psychics either on a whim, or desperate to hear good news. At times I'm sure it even helps! A "everything will be okay" can lift us up from our worries. 

But I can see the negatives as well. A confirmation that everything will be great removes us from the need to take the very action that would lead to "everything being okay."


### You are in control.

You are in control of your life. You make your future. Your present is what your past self has made for you. 

It's a hard pill for many people to swallow. 



Now for context, it'll help to understand that for months leading up to the move, I had been pursuing a long-distance relationship, of which my boyfriend of five years consented to, having discussed exploring polyamory with him well in advance.

Polyamory is a relatively new concept in relationships, which translates literally to "many loves." It's the dynamic of having multiple romantic partners, emphasizing openness, honesty, 




Reflection 

Many people don't reflect on their actions or circumstances. Most people don't save money, are in jobs they don't love, etc. 
 
Reflection requires an ability to be alone with your own thoughts long enough that your inner demons may make themselves known, a length of time that in this age of easy distractions seems like an unnecessary torment. 

Liberation is being able to be alone with your thoughts. 

If you don't understand the motives of your actions, chances are, those motives are not your own. Where are you conforming to the expectations of others? How would it be feel to be free of those shackles? Why don't you just take them off, the imprisonment has always been an illusion anyways. 

The Devil
Here's something to think about when faced with a hard decision.

The Devil tarot card is the most feared and misunderstood. Upon seeing the most sinister character to ever exist, it's easy to imagine an abyss of evil where all your worst fears are realized. 

But here lies the trick, the card up the Devil's sleeve, so to say. Fear is not the punishment, but the tool. The bondage is not some eternal hell, but the life lived avoiding going after what you desire, avoiding diving into the challenges that invigorate you with life, and instead opting for a safe survival free of the responsibility of deciding where to go next. Don't worry, everything will be okay. Put the chain on your neck, and you'll never have to make a scary decision ever again. 

> Look closely at the card, and you'll see that the chains on the man and woman are loose and could easily be removed. The Devil cannot take control without  ongoing permission. 

The Devil, far from evil incarnent, is actually the caretaker of those who refuse to take care of themselves. Actually, can you think of anything more evil than the act of freely giving up your free will?

When faced with a decision, seriously ask yourself, what do you want? Which path challenges you towards exalted happiness, and which sounds like the comforting clanking of the limited mobility of chains?

It's only in understanding our fears that they don't control us anymore. 


Make your future 

Choose love instead.

There are many things I've learned that I want to share, but first I want to share a post that will give some context: [Planning Life Around Period]

Sounds super weird, but hear me out when I say, planning my life around my period is one of the best things I've done, and I've been doing it to great success for a year and a half.
