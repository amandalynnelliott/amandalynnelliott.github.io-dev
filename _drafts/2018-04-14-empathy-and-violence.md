What Mass Shooters Teach About Empathy 

Since sharing my story has opened the flood gates for me to empathize with people on deeper levels than ever before, I am at the same time, incredibly relieved, while also overwhelmed by all of the understanding I am gaining. 

I wasn't able to write my story until I let myself empathize with mass killing shooters. I had so much resistance to looking, to feeling what they feel, but once I stopped looking away and starting looking in, I was able to understand more than ever before. 

There is a choice before us. Do we continue to write violent acts off as committed by "monsters," or do we attempt to empathize them in order to learn? Do you believe they were victims of genetics and that their fate was etched in stone? Or do you believe that they were victims of circumstance, and given then right circumstances, you could have easily been standing in their shoes?

Let's endure the discomfort of standing in their shoes long enough to see what we can learn. 

"Filling the conscious mind with ideal conceptions is characteristic of Western theosophy, but not the confrontation with the shadow and the world of darkness. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the dark conscious." - Carl Jung

Disclaimer: The following are my own insights from doing this empathetic exercise, along with my own evolving perspective that is always a work-in-progress. I want to emphasize how I don't have all of the answers. We need serious ongoing dialogue. Don't accept anything I say here as fact without doing your own inquiry, and feel free to present opposing perspectives. This post is less about the need to confine violent individuals as much as it is about the need to prevent violent desires in the first place. 

### Empathetic Breaks

I believe this: We need empathy now more than ever. We need to look inside ourselves so that we can look inside others. We need to heal ourselves so that we can begin to help others heal too. 

To understand mental illness, let's look at the example of a broken bone. If you have a broken bone, you go to the doctor, get a cast, and are told not to use that bone for six weeks so that it can heal. Largely the healing process happens on it's own, independent of medical professionals. 

This is not what happens with the "mentally ill." Those that experience breaks or "broken bones" in their ability to relate to their own emotions and to the emotions of others, will naturally behave erratically. In this state, it takes extra effort to relate to them and find out what they need, but that in no way means that they are lost.

But our actions say that we believe they are lost. We set them up for a lifelong dependence on medications, while completely ignoring their painful broken bone in desperate need of being set.

There is much more money to be made in treating symptoms than causes. I am not a conspiracy theorist, but this simple fact cannot be overlooked. Having a lifelong dependent user of a medication makes for big financial incentives, but it will never address the root, and will never lead to the healing that can only happen on an individual level: Healing the broken connection that we have with ourselves. The connection we have with both our own emotions and the emotions of others are both one in the same.

Telling a person that their mind, emotions, thoughts are the enemy that there is no escape from, and that it will never get better, is the recipe for the exact pain that we are all suffering from. The drugs we are given to "help" simply numb our ability to feel and empathize, until it builds to the point of eruption, resulting in a body count. 

### Manipulation vs Trust 

Our institutions don't understand individuals, only the collective. Our relationships with our institutions like school and mental health are manipulative ones: operating on the form of reward and punishment. Any behavior that is out of uniform, is not empathized with, but instead met with punishment in order to enforce homogeneity.

Does calling these institutions manipulative sound too extreme?

[Give up my free will]

I have a confession to make. I have lived a double life. I have lied. For a period of six months, I worked in the shadows with an older individual who I thought was my mentor and partner, but who the whole time, was manipulating me. How could I have been so desperate? So stupid? How could I have given my power away so willingly? 

I still don't know this man's real name, which tells you a lot about how desperate I was, and how good he was at playing my desires.

The first rule he made before allowing me the "privilege" of working with him was for me not to tell anyone about our working relationship. I believed the reasons he gave to justify it, which of course, make no sense to me now. I hated navigating the web of secrets and hidden intentions that followed. I have never been so isolated and confused before in my life. 

He played me like a fiddle. Fresh out of school, I was desperate for career success. In my mind, massive success felt like the missing piece that would lead to the authentic acceptance that I would sacrifice anything in order to have. 

He would dangle this vision of success in front of me, while pushing me to extremes with the promise of "soon." I was desperate for his approval of me, which would be doled out at unpredictable times. Anxiously, sometimes my actions would be met with approval, while other actions with guilt, often even using my own words against me. It got to the point where I was recording my conversations with people, because I thought I was going crazy. It got to the point where I couldn't trust myself to send an email without forwarding it to him so that he could proof-read and edit it first. If it took him too long to reply, I would hyperventilate.

Before this even started, for nearly a year, he worked me into this blind admiration and dependence of him. He would frequently come to my publicly hosted meetups,  pulling me aside afterwards saying how much he believed in me and wanted to invest $10,000 in helping me start a business. I was excited about this... Too excited. Blinded, really. 

He kept his appearances infrequent and unpredictable. He had even stopped communicating with me entirely. Having not seen him for months, I literally wondered if he was dead. 

He showed up months later asking if I had learned my "lesson," or rather, his justified reason for abandoning me for that extended period of time. The "lesson" was that I did not value him enough. This action spoke volumes: This was not a two-way relationship. He would tell me what to do, and I would unquestioningly do it, or he would abandon me again. 

His intelligence, stories, and charismatic personality made me feel like he really did hold the key to success that I would be lost without. I began to believe that he was the best thing that had happened to me, and decided that I would do anything in order to prevent him from abandoning me again. Even living a double life.

I thought he was teaching me business, but what he actually was teaching me was how to be like him and manipulate others. I would walk out of networking events and meetings feeling utterly disgusting. I had stopped seeing people as people, but as objects that would be lumped into two categories: Useful or Not. 

This individual caused me so much pain, and yet, I am able to empathize with him and how he got to this point of interacting with people. We might as well have been looking into a mirror, the same pain being reflected back to each other. 

You only feel the need to manipulate others when you don't trust them. When you don't trust them to naturally have your best interest at heart and accept you, but instead, think that they want to hurt you. Manipulation is a coping mechanism in order to get your needs met without being vulnerable in the act of expressing what those needs actually are. I would say that the distrust in schools that leads to manipulative practices runs rampant: administrators don't trust teachers, who don't trust students, who don't trust each other... A system built on distrust will never teach individuals how to trust themselves. 

We barely trust teachers to teach, and now we want to give them guns? 

Reward and punishment methods lead to the conditioned habit of constantly feeling guilty, doubting your every decision and action, and ever-present anxiety: all tell-tale signs of being manipulated. 

Looking back before that experience, I felt the familiar manipulation-hangover right after graduating school. In fact, leaving the comforting authority of school is what paved the way for me to be so easily manipulated. I was desperate for another authority to tell me what I "should" do, and was willing to steamroll over every internal feeling I had screaming at me in the process. 

Quarter-life and midlife crises are literally less extreme versions of "mental illness" episodes. In these cases, they are realignments from doing what others have wanted you to do, to doing what you want to do, all awhile working to trust that those desires can be one in the same. 

### Cycle of Powerlessness and Punishment

"Mental Illness" is actually a recent term. Until recent psychological memory, these misunderstood afflictions were referred to as "Behavioral Disorders." Both terms miss the point, but the evolution in terminology makes the person feel even more powerless. It's an evolution from "My behavior is disordered" to "My brain is broken."

As a society, what do we do with destructive behavior that we don't understand? We punish the person for it. 

If a person already wants to die or to kill others, can you see how punishing them is an utterly useless tactic in how to deal with them, an action that even makes them worse? Punishment only works on people who are afraid of losing their connection to others. Those that seek violence are in so much pain because they believe their connection to others is already lost.

If you broke your bone in an accident, and every person around you wanted to isolate and punish you for it, how would that make you feel? 

Powerlessness is the emotion felt by people trapped by the mental illness label. Powerlessness is the emotion felt by their caregivers. The "mentally ill" person does not feel like their emotional pain is being listened to or seen, so if yelling doesn't work, then they escalate to self-harm. If self-harm doesn't work, then they escalate to harming others. 

I want you to imagine being told that you are insane, and then being driven by the person that you trust the most in the world against your will to get you treatment that will only make you feel worse. How would you feel? Would you try jumping out of the moving car? Would you do anything to escape the powerlessness that you are experiencing? 

Now imagine the perspective of the loved one taking you. They have no idea what you need and are tremendously scared of and for you. They are listening to everything professionals are telling them to do, but still, your behavior becomes more unpredictable and extreme. How do they feel? What do they feel when you try jumping out of the car? Would they do anything to escape the powerlessness that they are experiencing? 

This powerlessness is a mirror being reflected back into each other.  In not acknowledging it, our actions escalate. The cycle will continue to perpetuate, eventually resulting in death, ONLY UNTIL AND UNLESS the opposite feeling is introduced in order to break the cycle: Empowerment.

### Loving vs Hating Yourself

Would you want to live if trained professionals were telling you that you could not trust how you felt, and that your already horrible life was only going to get worse? Nobody wants to live if they believe that they are trapped in an never-ending hell with no hope. Nobody wants to live physically present but emotionally isolated from others. As somebody who has personally called the Suicide Hotline and has been able to come back from the experience, I can tell you with certainty: THERE IS HOPE. 

What saved me was prioritizing how I felt. I started a 365 Day Self-Love Challenge where I made every single decision based on the answer I got when I would ask myself the question "What would somebody who loved themselves do?" I would ask it all day, everyday, including to what brings me to writing this here for you. I am relieved to be able to tell my past trapped self, that because of my commitment to prioritizing how I feel over all else, I live a very fulfilling life now. It wasn't an accident and it wasn't easy. I had to learn to connect to my emotions, instead of ignoring, suppressing, and disowning them. The only way to learn from a feeling is to listen to it.-- What does this feeling need you to know? What does it need you to do differently?

You love or hate yourself in proportion to how much you trust yourself to have your best interest at heart. Ignoring how you feel means that you can never hope to give yourself what you truly want, because you don't know what that is. The resulting pain your actions cause you leads to hating yourself for it. Alternatively,  the more you trust yourself, the more you love yourself. Repairing your relationship with yourself is required in order, not only to survive, but also to thrive in tandem with others.

### Painful Healing

If you are struggling with a web of negative thoughts ricochetting in your head, a diagnosis that absolves you from the responsibility of fully feeling and learning from these painful emotions, is a tempting excuse not to do the painful work. 

The risk of considering that you are in control of your mind, would be to accept that for thinking this way in the first place, that you are a bad person: you are lazy, evil, stupid, worthless, and a whole host of other bad judgements, and need to be punished for it. We will do anything in order to maintain our connection to others, even if it means living in a hell constructed by our own self-criticisms. We are so close together, we could touch, we could understand, but our judgments might as well be pushing us miles apart from each other. 

Experiencing the pain already within you is like setting a broken bone. It is temporary. It is necessary. You will be able to walk again now.

### Not Identifying  

Once you stop identifying with your thoughts, you stop believing that you need to punished for having bad thoughts, clearing the way for healing. 

You are NOT your thoughts. 
You are NOT your feelings. 

You in no way need to identify with your thought/feelings. Actually, the best way to learn from them is to let the thought/feelings pass through you without judgement. After a good cry, you will feel tremendous release. You will have learned something, which is what these emotions have been desperately wanting for you all along. They never intended to set up camp within you indefinitely. They have been wanting to flow through you so that you can move on. 

### Tools of Death 

When I was in middle school, we often would come to class in the morning met with a single-file line of bag searches, and then be marched across to a nearby school, a safe-haven where we would apprehensively wait for hours while our own school was being searched for explosives. These bomb threats occurred so many times that teachers had to be proactive in developing lesson plans that could be made mobile on a moment's notice. 

That was over 10 years ago. 

Notice that throughout my posts where I talk about mass shooters, I do not mention gun control once. The tools of death and destruction have always been numerous. What has not been so numerous is the desire to harm others in an attempt to end internal suffering. 

### Mental Free-Will

Every person has the power to direct their attention through focus. Every person can choose to think thoughts that incrementally start making them feel better so that they can reintegrate past pain, instead of letting their negative thoughts spiral out of control and consume them. Yet we say to millions of people that this is an impossible feat for them because they are broken, so they don't even try. Is it really that surprising that so many spiral out of control? 

The sorrow that comes with empathizing with a mass shooter is realizing that their decent into darkness could have been avoided. Our only tactics to deal with them is to take away their mental free-will by making an enemy of it, and so they are only left to relate to themselves and to others as enemies. They will then use their physical free-will to try ending the pain by killing the enemies.  

I believe that every single person on this planet is always taking the actions that they take because they believe doing so will make them feel better. Even if those actions result in hurting others, it is no exception. It is important to stop looking for people to blame, to judge, to punish, because it blocks you from being able to empathize with them and seeing what they desperately need in order to heal. Look into the mirror of somebody's eyes, see yourself looking back, and use what you learn to write your own future. 

### Getting Past Anger

Please don't be mad at shooters. 
Please don't be mad at mental health professionals. Please don't be mad at the police. 
Please don't be mad at school staff. 
Please don't be mad at yourself. 

It took me 2 years to write [my story] because that's how long it took for me to let go of the anger that was blocking me from being able to empathize with all people involved. Nobody is the enemy and you are not the enemy. Trust yourself and trust others. 

We don't need the mental healthcare institution nearly as much as we need the judgment-free empathy from our loved ones. We need to rebuild our communities. We need to truly feel ourselves and be felt by others. We need to learn how to put ourselves back together again. 


We might also need lots of tissue boxes and hugs.

Institutions are inherently psychopathic. John Taylor Gatto

Can somebody please tell me how I can get a copy of the DSM? Elusive to buy

I regret to inform you that our institutions as we have them today are psychopathic. They will not empathize with you, and the people that comprise them are just scared. I see my old self in them a lot... A person being manipulated to manipulate others.
