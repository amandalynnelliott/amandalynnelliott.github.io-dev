Faith and Invention

<blockquote>“We have to continually be jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down.”
<footer>― Kurt Vonnegut</footer></blockquote>

Faith used to be a dirty word to me, a word that meant foolishly believing in the unreal.

I considered myself a rational person. I told myself that I must see first, and *only then* will I believe.

Things changed when my family was in crisis. I had no reason to believe that things were going to get better. All of the evidence, the doctors, the accepted facts and statistics, pointed to the contrary: Things, unbearable as they were already, were only going to get worse from here.

// When the dark night of the soul breaks on your back, shrouding you in a black sky without a stars, you either crack under the immense pressure, or become a star yourself. You tap into your own light source, your power, your light.

When there is nowhere left to turn, turn inward.

I couldn't continue living without faith. The only way I could keep moving forward, was to believe that things were going to get better, inspite of evidence. There's nothing rational about my beliefs, but they make me feel better about living.

### Secular Depression

The word for the belief system that I used to have, that most of our secular society operates under, is called **logical positivism**. It states that no statements have meaning except those backed by impirical evidence.
[Failures of Scientific Atheism] The founders of this ideology wanted a society where religion and philosophy was stripped of any power, and where only Science held ultimate truth, the God of a secular world.

For better or for worse, we have this scientifically founded society. The downside of stripping religion and philosophy from our lives--from trying to remove any trace of subjectivity from existence--can be felt in the form of emptiness and depression.

Logical positivism leaves us feeling isolated without meaning. Cutting yourself off from meaning makes harder to cope with the challenges of the world--it certaintly didn't help me.

There are many grey areas of our existence that science has yet to answer--like, what happens to us after we die? What is the meaning of it all? And we are supposed to live in this void, reject any potential answers, and wait for Science to deliver us?

Not me.

### Imagine Something Better

<blockquote>“Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions”
<footer>― Albert Einstein</footer></blockquote>

The interesting thing that happened for my life, is the more I let myself imagine my life getting better, to feel the hope, the more it did. 




<blockquote>"Using logic all on its own to disect the disparate events of life can sometimes tell you how things have happened and may also provide that might help you in preventing future disasters. But logic can't show you the underlying causal forces, can't reveal the mystery or the magic, and can't answer the question **Why?**"
<footer>― Colette Baron Reid</footer></blockquote>



Visualizing catastrophes is a poor use of imagination.



Most scientists have faith in the closet




Faith requires an exercise in imagination. Taking the "leap of faith" can easily become an act of suicide without see the ledge on the other side and believing that you can make it.

<blockquote>“Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.”

We want to be rational. We don't want to be disappointed.

It is not the mindset of leaders and inventors to only focus on what is commonly accepted, but on the edges. Visionaries are strange. Their insights stir visceral reactions in us. 

History has not been kind to most visionaries. The more resistant to change we are as a culture, the more they suffer at our hand. They lie in silent anguish, their works a well-kept secret, or condemned to drink poision--a justly punishment for "poisioning the minds of youth." 

Do you think faith is dangerous?

Those with faith are regarded as foolish and are met with concern, and why wouldn't we be? We are standing on ground that doesn't exist--yet. 

People with faith change things, and change is uncomfortable. The very act of innovation also makes what existed before obsolete. 

This was made painfully aware to industrial titan J.D.Rockefeller, whose kerosine lighting business took a major hit after Edison's lightbulb invention. Light without flame, who would've thought! You can see how this encouraged Rockefeller and his fellow titans to shape the education system into what we have today: a monopoly that directly stifles out-of-the-box thinking. The Edison's of the world are sitting in remedial classes and special ed, too bored to engage, and feeling too stupid to do anything meaningful, so why even try? We justify this system because well, I had to go, and so do you, son, as did my parents, and their parents... My, we are so afraid of change that we are willing to do this to people! 

[End of education rant. Those require separate posts--separate series of posts.]




What do you have faith in? What are you risking?


My transition from visual hired gun to emotion & consciousness researcher. Used to be obsessed with skill development. Felt like outside approval was missing from my life. Feel much better. Trusting the path to unfold before me. 


Leaders vs Dreamers

Faith is beyond fantasy. 

Faith is what allows you to persevere through failure. Without faith, Thomas Edison would have been a person who dreamed and talked about the concept of a lightbulb, maybe even got people excited about it, but he never would've gone through the trials and tribulations to make it a reality, and we wouldn't know his name today.

Can you imagine going through a thousand failed experiments without faith?

"Persons with high levels of personal mastery... cannot afford to choose between reason and intuition, or head or heart, any more than they would choose to work on one leg or see with one eye."
<footer>― Peter Sage</footer></blockquote

When a person's faith in their inner knowing surpasses their fear in standing apart from what the collective assumes to be true, they become a leader. This shift is what transforms a dreamer into a leader. 

Trying to lead from a place of wishful thinking and blind optimism is exhausting. Leadership requries a lot of energy, but it's not accurate to say that this energy only is generated within the leader. This energy is given to the leader from those he is tapping into--in resonance with--listening to. 




Funny how counter-intuitive listening to your intuition actually is!

It seems like a rational way of working smarter. Less work, more results.

Inner conflict an exhausting drain on your energy. I can't rationalize having my intuition at odds with my mind. The only justifications come from fear, which isn't a fun way to live.




SHADOW of a DOUBT

Doubt clouds your intentions. Dims the light of consciousness. This happens when we get conditioned to prioritize how others perceive us over how we feel.

What would you be doing if you already were "successful?" If you already had all the money and accolades you could ever need?

What would you be doing if you knew that you were never going to be successful--never attaining significant wealth or achievement? What would you do to occupy your humble existence?

In considering your answers to these two questions, what overlaps? What work would you be doing no matter how others perceived you?


I recently applied the above thinking to my own career trajectory, and I was surprised by the result. I realized that my desire to produce art and to animate has not been nearly as strong as my desire to research and write--specifically into the topics of *emotions and consciousness*. 

Working on my visual skills and getting clients has felt like an uphill battle for a while. I only recently realized that I would never be happy as a visual "hired gun"--taking art commissions or animation jobs in order to execute somebody else's message. I've recently accepted--I am first and foremost a writer, the one conveying the message.

LET GO
EASE
Focus on ease. Not necessarily easy, but followed by a sense of relief.


The True Nature of Inspiration

We are all frequency. You resonate strongly with an action only because there are other beings who are matching your giving frequency on the recieving side. 

*Inspiration is a telepathic call-to-action.*

Inspiration is an indication of cosmically-supported energy transference.



Faith. Inspiration. Intuition. These are all the same words for the same thing. 

<p class="sidenote">
vocare (v.) Latin - to answer a call; usually describes life in a religious order but also means to recognize "a voice." This voice is distinct and like no other. It invites you to follow it.
</p>

The word vocation literally translates to a calling--something you have been called to do. 

You can call this voice a number of things. Your higher self, Spirit, Source, God, the Universe...

What leaps of faith are you taking?

My faith project is "mental illness." This area is not working. Alternative therapies and healing





I have made peace with my faith and the risk that expressing it requires. The ground I stand on does not exist yet, but I invite you join me in building it together.

No path is better than the one taken on unwavering faith. The gift is not the destination, but the journey. It's not what comes to be, but what you are *becoming*.
