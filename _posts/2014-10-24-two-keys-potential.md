I made this illustration a year ago when I was playing with the idea of unlocking one’s potential, and (as any eighteen year old would be) I was confused and overwhelmed.

Self-discovery is quite confusing and overwhelming, and so I did my best to illustrate to illustrate the anguish of a teenager asking, What should I do?… Which path is right for me? Which college is right for me? Which major? Is the debt worth it? How can I reach my artistic potential without an art degree? … *Which keys unlock my potential?*<!--more-->

However, I was definitely not alone in my anxiety about the future. Young adults are fantastic at asking the question, “What should I do with my life,” but are terrible at answering the question, “What do you *want* to do with your life?”

It’s the result of a fantastic kind of brainwashing–young adults leave school institutionalized. Hopefully in reading this, you’ll learn how to take control of your life again, and discover the two keys to unlocking your true potential.

### Why we don’t know our potential already: Being in School Erodes Your Ability to Make Decisions

When at first you become confined to an institution, you can’t want to leave–can’t wait for freedom. But the observed phenomenon of becoming institutionalized is that the longer you stay confined and not in control, then the more your ability to make decisions becomes eroded, and the more you start to fear freedom. The result that is seen in high school is even more drastic in prison.

**I once watched an interview of a healthy man who, recently released from prison, couldn’t make the most basic decisions about his life.** “What will you have for lunch” turned into a horrible transaction where after several painful minutes he, unable to undertake the overwhelming task of making a decision, would say, “I’ll have what he’s having.”

After having years of an authority deciding what you eat, when you sleep, where you go and what you do every single hour of every single day, it can be easy to see how hard it would be to take your life back.

Institutionalization is observed in long-term prisoners as their sentences drag on, years turn into decades, and instead of looking forward to their day of release, they fear it. And after being released, some ex-convicts even commit crimes immediately afterwards just so that they can be put back in jail again, so that they can be relieved from the taxing duty of being in charge of their lives.

What happens to prison inmates is not so different from what happens to high school students. **You go through the majority of your conscious life having various authority figures decide what you learn, when, and how.** Children get so used to trying to please the authority that they grow into adults forgetful that they are the ones in control–responsible for their learning and for their life.

*We look forward to graduating high school because it is like a jail sentence ending, but at the same time we dread it because now, all of a sudden, we’re in control of our lives for the first time.* Our ability to make decisions slowly has been eroded throughout our adolescence, we don’t know our potential–who we are or what we can do–and yet, upon graduation, that authority in our life suddenly demands us to take control and says, “What are you going to do with your life now?!”

So what do we do, confused and clueless about who we are and what makes us happy in life, and with authority demanding for us to decide anyways? We jump into yet another comfort zone: more education–college. We halfheartedly choose a major from a brochure, and go with that. We hand over our life’s direction to yet authority figure, because we cannot bear to be left alone to our own devices. That, at least is my take on it.

**There is great comfort in having somebody else decide everything for you–but it hinders personal growth.** The shock of life happens when a college graduate goes out into the real world, and discovers that the major they halfheartedly chose wasn’t right for them. Or worse–they realize decades later that they’ve wasted most of their life in a job that they just stuck with because “a job is a job,” because they truly believed that they weren’t in control of their present happiness.

**I have news for you, you *are* in control.** Of your education, of your career, and of your life. You can’t go through life trying to please everybody; it’s just not possible. People may want you to be a doctor, a lawyer, an accountant, but if that’s not what you want to do, then simply ignore it. People may want you to decide your life’s direction at eighteen, you poor clueless soul, but if you aren’t ready (you’re probably not) then postpone the decision. Where’s the fire? There is none. There’s no rush.

*And since you can’t make everybody happy, then you might as well make yourself happy. After all, you are the one living with yourself and your life decisions more than anybody else.*

Stop living in fear of society. Stop asking, “What should I do,” and instead answer the question, “What do *I want* to do?” Take control of your life and how you make the world a better place. What do you feel like you were born to do? What’s the work you can’t *not* do? How can you live a fulfilled life making the world a better place?

Answer the questions, don’t ask anymore. No authority figure in your life should have a voice louder than your own.

I can’t answer the questions for you, but I can give you a road map to start your journey.

After a year of regular weekly self-reflections to de-institutionalize myself, I’ve discovered that discovering yourself is a two-part act. The key you need to unlock the worlds within you is found only within, and it consists of two repeating steps.

Like the pull in, pull out, yin-yang of the waves of the ocean, and the breathe-in, breathe-out of your breath, to discover yourself and your ideal path in life, you do two things, in a never-ending cycle: **Explore and Reflect.**

<blockquote>
“It is, however, necessary to combine the two things, solitude and the crowd, and to have recourse alternately: the former will make us long for people, the latter for ourselves, and the one will cure the other. Our distaste for crowds will be cured by solitude, our boredom with solitude by the crowd.”
<footer>–Seneca</footer>
</blockquote>

![key - explore and reflect sketch]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/cc/key-explore-reflect.png)

## 1. Explore the real world.

<blockquote>
“We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.”
<footer>– T.S. Eliot</footer>
</blockquote>

Exploring is crucial to figuring out what you want to do in life, because it’s important to be exposed to many different life paths to fully realize your options. But more so than the types of majors offered at your nearby college, it’s important to explore life outside of institutions. **If the only people you generally meet are teachers and other students, then you are seriously short-changing your personal growth.**

Besides college, internet may also at first seem like great grounds to explore, and it definitely is, but to some extent the web makes us more capable of “shallow” thinking and less capable of “deep” thinking. As T. S. Eliot asked, “**Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?**” In order to deeply explore the world around us, we need to avoid getting lost in a digital storm of information–a world’s worth of clamor channeling through our phones is something that can easily overwhelm us instead of empowering us.

Michael Harris in his book, The End of Absence, expressed how he was worried that his generation (born 1980s) was the last of the daydreamers. He said, “*One doesn’t see teenagers staring into space anymore. Gone is the idle mind of the adolescent.*” With the internet constantly streaming constant connection and entertainment for teens when they burrow themselves in their phones, it can be worrisome that daydreaming is becoming lost art–gone in an age where boredom is in the process of being eradicated.

<blockquote>
“Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.”
<footer>– Rainer Maria Rilke, poet</footer>
</blockquote>

**In order to explore, we have to find time for *lack* of knowledge.** We need to look past our desire to know *now*. Living a question requires a fondness for absence that seems to be in short supply.

**The paradox of choice is that access to everything encourages exploration of nothing.** Just as in the 4 Hour Workweek, author Tim Ferris encourages his readers to partake in a “low-information diet” by avoiding web-surfing and watching the news, and as Benjamin Franklin had a notion of “philosophical self-denial”, *in this Digital Age we now have to lower our intake of the information and connectivity we’re hardwired to adore, in the same way we now lower our intake of the sugars and fats we’re designed to horde.*

Internet connections are in sum, fast food and dire nourishment in one. There was a [National Geographic article](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/hunger/) a few months ago about how people in poverty, living off of cheap fast food, can be obese and yet starving. It seems impossible–to be overindulging and yet undernourished–but in our Digital Age where communication dominates experience, isn’t that the similar predicament we are in?

**We see more, yet our vision is blurred. We feel more things, yet we are numbed. We constantly entertain ourselves with flashing screens, yet we are bored. Our technology obliterates distance, yet we feel lonely.**

My decree for you is to explore. To *truly* and *deeply* explore. To go out into the world *without* being leashed to your phone. I’m sick of seeing silent college students waiting for class, bored and yet too busy being burrowed in their phones to meet one-another.

Explore beyond your class requirements and beyond your school campus. You never know what kinds of amazing things you’ll learn or people you’ll bump into in the real world: maybe an exciting magician’s assistant, a suave branding consultant, or even your next mentor. But you won’t meet them if you never leave campus and if you never look up from your phone.

In the real world hides *slower* and *rarer* possibilities beneath the digital maelstrom. Breathe deeply, and embark out to find them.

Exploring is the first part.

## 2. Seek solitary self-reflection.

<blockquote>
“This reminds me that real thinking requires retreat. True contemplation is a two-part act: We go out into the world for a time, see what they’ve got, and then we find some isolated chamber where all that experience can be digested. <b>You can never think about a crowd from its center. You have to judge it from a place of absence.</b>”
<footer>–Michael Harris, The End of Absence</footer>
</blockquote>

Now, after your exciting journey into the world, it’s important to come back, seek solitude, and reflect upon your adventure. The goal of solitary reflection to learn from your experiences on how you can cultivate happiness.

You ask yourself: *What did I learn? Did I enjoy learning that? Do I want to make a career of learning and applying these skills? What do I still need to learn, and where do I go from here?* Answering those questions will lend your next exploration.

Self-reflection is therapeutic and cleansing, but unfortunately in our hyper connected world, technology again poses a problem. When do our obligations to social networks allow for solitude? We’re constantly connected, but never alone, and always available to be interrupted. You can only truly self-reflect from a place of solitude, something that, along with loneliness, social media is attempting to banish.

Happiness is an odd thing, because it can’t be triggered by external things. Happiness only comes from within, and unhappiness does not come from lack, but actually excess.

Too much instant gratification, too much instant connection, and the dominance of quantity over quality makes us unappreciative of what we have and the gifts we have for the world. **Happiness is cultivated by defining what is vital to our existence, and what is excess, and by then removing that excess to free up our living for more of what is vital.** The distinction of what makes you happy, however, can only be made from a place of solitude.

<blockquote>
“I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life and to see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.”
<footer>–Henry David Thoreau, Walden Pond</footer>
</blockquote>

Solitude helps you in that all-encompassing goal of living without regret. (*For more on goal-setting, read [4 Goal-Setting Techniques for Dreamers](LINK NEEDED)*)

It can be assumed from Henry David Thoreau’s quote above, that the majority of time that takes up the everyman’s life (buying, selling, and managing) and be categorized as “not-life.” **Solitude helps keep you from drowning in that “what is not life,” by allowing you to discern what is “real life” from what is not.** Once you make those important distinctions, then you can cut away the fat in order to live meaningfully.

My decree to you, is to embark on a tour of solitude. Explore the back-country of your own life, of your mind, your ambitions. By limiting the number of moments that bring you into society, whether that be online or off, you make those moments more meaningful. To strive for solitude is not for fear of life, but for lust of life.

<blockquote>
“[N]ot until we have lost the world, do we begin to find ourselves…”
<footer>–Henry David Thoreau</footer>
</blockquote>

Solitude may cause discomfort, but that discomfort is an inspiring sort–and it’s the only time when you truly can receive unexpected notions. Seek solitude because you have something to find out about yourself. **To explore yourself, you *must* seek solitude, and fear of solitude is the surest sign that it is needed.** (See the animation, [the Innovation of Loneliness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6Bkr_udado))

When it comes to reflection, I am a strong advocate for making it a weekly habit. Set a time, and every week, go over experiences you just had that week: the people you just met, things you’ve accomplished and learned. Then use your new-found experience to reevaluate your long-term goals. Do your goals still fit you? Do you need to change direction? What are you going to do next week?

**When you don’t know where you are going, what do you do?
You *stop* moving.** 

You look at a map and make sure you’re not going the wrong way. That’s exactly what regular self-reflection helps you do. It helps you avoid making tremendous progress towards a goal that doesn’t even benefit you. It helps you avoid wasting your energy and time in order to make you happier, more fulfilled, and more disciplined.

**Your reflection will lend your next exploration, which will lend your next reflection… in a never-ending cycle.** Breath in, breath out. Go out, explore the world, and come back, seek solitude and reflect upon your recent experiences. In following that cycle, within time, you’ll discover how to find and unlock the potential hiding within you. Exploring and reflecting is the key.

## Reflection Roadblock
#### "But I don't know what to write."

I advocate for weekly reflections a lot, and a metric I usually tell people to start with is 500 words a week. (It’s really not a lot! This post is almost 3000 words!) But the biggest roadblock people run into is that they don’t know what to write.

Here are some questions to get you started:

- What did you do this week? Why?
- What went well? What did you accomplish?
- What didn’t go well? Did you learn from any mistakes?
- Who did you meet? 
- What did you learn?
- What do you need to improve upon?
- What are you going to do next week? How will that make progress towards your long-term goals?
- What are your long-term goals again…? Do you still want to do those things? Why are these goals so important to you?

Those questions should hopefully give you some starting ideas. But let me be the first to tell you: in the beginning most writing is crap, because you’re just getting things down. It’s crap, it’s a mess, but that’s okay, because quality work all comes together in the organization.

<blockquote>
Poetry starts off as ramblings,
Illustrations start off as scribbles,
Symphonies start of as cacophonies,
It all comes together in the organization. 
</blockquote>

It’s usually not pretty in the beginning, but that doesn’t matter. It all comes together in the organization–in prioritizing and eliminating ideas and feelings. It’s like stringing beads together for a necklace. Simply get something down in the beginning, and organize your ideas later.

The journey is yours, and of course you don’t know where to go yet. You still have to draw your map!  Keep exploring and reflecting, and within time, you will have charted your destination.
