*Update: I didn't end up continuing this series.*

Recently I picked up a copy of [Roadtrip Nation](http://roadtripnation.com/about) at the local library, and it does not disappoint.

Roadtrip Nation is a book, [television series](http://www.pbs.org/roadtrip-nation/home/), and movement started by Mike Marriner and Nathan Gebhard, college students at the time who wanted to chart their own life paths instead of prescribing to somebody else’s. They had the crazy idea to go on a road trip across the country to interview successful people from all walks of life. In exploring and learning about a variety of different life paths, they gained advice to help others and themselves in their own life navigation.

Well, a book publisher just so happened to like this crazy idea, funded their trip across the country in an RV, and low and behold, the Roadtrip Nation movement was born.<!--more-->

## The Roadtrip Nation Manifesto

<p class="sidenote">
So what do you want to do with your life?<br><br>
“You should be a lawyer, a doctor, an accountant, a consultant… blah, blah blah.”<br><br>
Everywhere you turn people try to tell you who to be and what to do with your life. We call it the noise. Block it. Shed it. Leave it for the conformists.<br><br>
As a generation, we need to get back to focusing on individuality.<br>
Self-construction rather than mass production.<br><br>
Define your own road in life instead of traveling down someone else’s.<br>
Listen to yourself.<br>
Your road is the Open Road. Find it.<br><br>
Find the Open Road.
</p>

After reading the book, I got inspired to interview the many people I bump into randomly on a weekly basis. You don’t need to rent an RV and go across the country to find interesting people, after all. Oftentimes you don’t realize it, but the most interesting people are living among you, disguised as your next door neighbor, the guy waiting in line in front of you at the grocery store, and the lady reading a magazine next to you at the doctor’s office. To find out how amazing they are, you only need to ask.

### Find people with the secret sauce.

The advice I give to you when choosing who to talk to about life, is to choose the people who have the “secret sauce.” These are the people who radiate happiness, who are charismatic, and who enliven a room. Since your goal, as everyone’s is, is to find and cultivate happiest, seek advice from those who are joyful, and take the advice from those who aren’t with a grain of salt.

Never take life advice from people who hate their jobs.
As the saying goes, misery loves company!

Inspired to meet new people, I found out that a man who I had already met multiple times at my Toastmasters (public speaking) club surprisingly professionally freelances as a voice over actor, doing the voice acting for various radio and television commercials. From what I could tell, [Rob Ellis](https://www.facebook.com/robellisvoiceover/) loves what he does. I asked him if from a young age if he knew that was what he wanted to do, and he said yes. He had always loved radio.

Since I am also interested in becoming self-employed, I asked him if it was difficult to get started. Rob summed it up nicely, “**You gotta do what you gotta do**,” meaning that your passion might just be a side hobby for a while, maybe for a few years, maybe five, or maybe even a decade, and during that time you take the work that you can get, selling copiers even, awhile never losing sight of your dream.

Rob shared the advice that you have to ask yourself, “**What would you be doing if you could be doing anything in the world and if money wasn’t an object?**” Ask yourself what is the work that you would do for free. Identify that and you’ve found your perfect job, if you’re willing to work at it! If you don’t have an answer right away, that just means that you haven’t done enough exploring yet. Think about the things you loved to do as a young child before society put so many pressures on you, back when you were free to be true to yourself. What activities did you enjoy and interests did you have back then?

Your ability to work hard will help you, but natural interest is what will get you out of bed.

### Just get in the building. 

Rob Ellis and Roadtrip Nation also taught me the power of just getting in the building. Rob knew he wanted to get into radio, and so naturally jumped at the chance to get his first job there, even though it was the dreaded “God Hour” shift that nobody else wanted, getting there at 5 in the morning to manage a string of radio priests.

Even with the hours, with that job Rob said that with that he couldn’t have been happier. *He was in the building!* You never walk into your dream job right off the bat, but once you are in the building you can work your way up.

In Roadtrip Nation, the story of Mike Lazzo, was similar to that. Surprisingly, Mike’s job is to watch television. I kid you not, he gets paid by Cartoon Network to watch their shows and to have an opinion about them—to decide which shows air and when.

How did Mike Lazzo get the amazing job of getting paid to watch television, without ever attending college no less? You guessed it, he got into the building. His first job associated with the television network was in the mailroom, and believe it or not, he worked his way up from there. And just like Rob Ellis, with that job he couldn’t have been happier.

<blockquote>
“Delivering mail turned out to be the best job in the world because I got to know everybody in the company.”<br><br>
“They could have told me that I’d be digging holes; as long as there were TV monitors in the vicinity, I would have been happy.”

### The importance of exploration.

When faced with the daunting question, “What the heck are you going to do with your life,” it can be easy to continue going with the herd to pursue a career just because that’s what people tell you to do. Maybe the career has fantastic prospects, like being a doctor, but that should never be the sole deciding factor. What’s the point of living in prosperity if you can’t stand the job that gives you it?

In order to figure out what you want to do, or at least how to get started, it’s important to get exposed to a wide range of options on how to live your life.

When I was in high school, the career options we were presented with were limited. Not attending college was never an option, and when I expressed my desire to pursue art to my guidance counselor, she recoiled, saying that with how high my math and science scores were, I should be an engineer. “No… I think *that’s* your true passion,” she said.

While she had good intentions (during the time I was a member of an environmental science club, after all), I secretly always knew that art was my passion. But I began to feel guilty from what she said. **I started to feel that my self-worth as an artist would be less than my self-worth as a scientist.** Towards the end of senior year, I applied and got accepted to a nearby private university popular for its science departments (which is also my dad’s alma mater). I told myself that it was for the best, and that I could learn to love engineering with time, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was making a terrible mistake. Despite my counselor’s hope for me to be a scientist, I had to be true to myself and to my dreams. Realizing that, and having the courage to stick to my guns, that day was one of the happiest days of my life.

*Taking control of your life is liberating. Often times in your young life, you will be faced with decisions between what feels right to you, and what feels right to others. Always choose yourself. You deserve to be happy living the life *you* want to live.*

*There is no excuse for young adults not to be pursuing their dreams. Even if it doesn’t work out, you can look back without regret, knowing that you fully tried.*

As I’ve been learning about life from a variety of people, I’ve discovered the dirty little secret: You don’t need an ultimate goal. It won’t happen out how you plan it, it just won’t. As you continue to explore and to learn about yourself, you’ll find that your dreams have a way of evolving with you.

When it comes to interviewing people, it’s good to start with your interests, and then broaden your horizons from there. Let your curiosity guide you. Meet anyone you want. Nobody is out of reach until they tell you so. Ask to meet millionaires, minor celebrities, anyone. The worst thing that can happen is that they say no.

If all else fails, the “*I can drop by your office for twenty minutes—whenever you have time*” pitch is a difficult request to turn down.

Roadtrip Nation also has this awesome Road Map service, where by selecting your interests you get to “Define Your Road.”

Once you get your Roadmap, you can read and watch interviews from successful people who have similar Roadmaps. You’ll be surprised of who you end up getting inspired by.

Roadtrip Nation also suggests that you start by interviewing ten people:

- Three closely related to your hobbies and interests
- Three who work in industries you think you might enjoy
- Three whose lives you never imagined yourself living
- One recommended by a friend or relative

The book has awesome advice on how to introduce yourself, get the interview, and conduct it professionally. I highly recommend it.

### Take on one job a week for a year.

*The following is paraphrased from [The Art of Self-Directed Learning](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blakeboles/the-art-of-self-directed-learning), a new book by Blake Boles.*

Sean Aiken, like many of us, after taking the standard educational route was left with no idea on what to do with his life, and possessed no method to figure it out. Sean had attended standard high school in Canada, went straight into standard public college, and graduated with a standard bachelor’s degree in business.

After college everybody told Sean to “find his passion,” which just frustrated him because no one explained how to do that. He traveled briefly, felt stumped, and moved back home with his parents.

At this point, Sean could have abandoned his pursuit of meaningful work. He could have taken any job. Instead, he decided to take 52 jobs. One new job, every week, for a year.

As he asked his personal network, asking family and friends to take part in their jobs for one week at a time, he wrote about his experiences at his website, OneWeekJob.com.

Soon, Sean’s challenge spread online, and he started receiving offers from across North America to become a dairy farmer, advertising executive, bungee jumping instructor, baker, firefighter, and stock trader.

By the end of his journey, Sean had become a minor celebrity and decided to harness his moment of fame by writing a book, helping produce a documentary, and speaking to student groups around the world about his One Week Job project.
Sean had found his dream job–at least for the time being–and all it took was 52 little experiments.

Whether you’re looking for a new career, considering college majors, or pondering your next self-directed learning project, don’t just go with the first “right” answer. Come up with a second, third, fourth answer–or fifty-second. By investing the time necessary to deeply explore your options, you’ll feel more motivated to follow through on your commitment.
