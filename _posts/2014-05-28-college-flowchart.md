The thought of not going to college might seem absurd, but isn’t the outcome of many recent graduates also absurd?

The stress put on recent college graduates ladled with egregious amounts of student loan debt, who struggle to enter the workforce and are forced to take jobs that don’t even require a college degree, has reached new extremes.

One story even entailed a college graduated who couldn’t handle the stress of it all, opted to default on his student loans the only legal way you can: death. What made it worse, was that not to long after his suicide, student loan collectors didn’t skip a beat, and started harassing *his parents*.

In wake of the recent development of [student debt suicides](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/c-cryn-johannsen/student-loan-debt-suicides_b_1638972.html), I feel like this article had to be written. Is it really absurd to consider not going to college when the potential outcome is so horrible? I think not.

## Yes, college is an “investment in your future.” But just like any other investment, it’s not risk-free.

It’s difficult to weigh the possible risks in order to make a confident decision about higher education, because everybody rallies behind it without fault. The general consensus is, “So what if it’s expensive? It’s an investment in your future!” (I explored why this is in [Why College is Too Expensive](LINK HERE).)

College is *not* be the “no-brainer “investment in your future” that everyone makes it out to be. It is also a *gamble.* I say this because sometimes, it doesn’t work out. There is risk involved with any life decision, but the risk of college often has tens of thousands of dollars and four years of your youth *on the line*.

**Investing in the stock market is also an investment in your future, so let’s not pretend that there isn’t any risk involved.**

So let’s take a deep breath, assess what a college education consists of, assess the risks, and you can decide for yourself is college is the right gamble for you, at the right time, or not.

I made this flowchart to help explain.

## The Breakdown: <br>The 6 things you are buying when you buy a degree

### 1. A Job When You Get Out

Future financial security is the main promise of college. The problem, though, is that a college degree no longer automatically guarantees that.

<blockquote>
53 percent of recent college graduates are jobless or underemployed.
<footer>–<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/04/53-of-recent-college-grads-are-jobless-or-underemployed-how/256237/">The Atlantic</a></footer>
</blockquote>

That means that more than half of graduates did not benefit from getting their degree, and they are either unemployed, or likely working minimum wage entry level jobs that don’t even require a degree.

The reality is, is that there’s a chance that it won’t work out. There’s a chance that the degree you invest four plus years of your life and thousands of dollars of borrowed money won’t improve your prospects. **These are the realities of higher education today, because yes, it is an investment in your future, but just like any other investment, it’s also a *gamble*.**

**However, where getting a degree actually does indisputably improve your chances of getting a job, is when you want to enter *licensed profession*, or professions that you *cannot* enter without a degree.** Medicine, law, engineering, and teaching are all licensed fields that you need a degree before you can enter than field.

Other than those fields though, you’d be surprised how few gatekeepers exist.

In general, to make a living with a skill you just need proof that you have that skill. While the proof for licensed professions needs to be more regulated, for many other skills (design, writing, video production, etc), you can show that proof through online portfolios, blogs, forum postings, video, and the many other ways you can share your work through the interwebs. By doing so, you build authority and your own alternative credential.

### 2. Knowledge

The next you are buying when you buy a degree is knowledge, or access to curated information.

**Learning does not require a debt-sentence, because thanks to the internet, learning has never been cheaper.**

While the information on the internet is free, it is scatterbrained, contradicting itself, and often overwhelming.

**In a time when information on virtually everything is free, you aren’t paying college for the information, you are paying college for the *structure* of the information.**

However, through the web there are many independent people, schools, and companies offering structured and curated information through online courses, assignments, webinars, and forums. Often these are much cheaper than college courses, countless being free (MOOCs, countless free ebooks, free workbooks, and free email courses) and many for the reasonable price range of $50-400.

**College was intended as a way for people to better themselves in ways they couldn’t on their own. Except that, for many professions, you can better yourself on your own.** We do it everyday.

### 3. Access to Resources You Need to Learn

![self-directed learning comic]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/cc/comic/surgery.png)

If you desire to learn a skill or trade, like welding, but lack the resources to learn on your own, then apprenticeship and trade programs are beneficial pursuits.

If you also desire to enter the field of science research, then you could benefit from the vast research facilities that colleges have to offer.

In these instances, though, you still aren’t paying for the knowledge so much as you are paying for access to resources you need to foster your learning.

 “Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is.”

</blockquote>

### 4. Community

**Granted, colleges do have a monopoly on communities of early twenty-somethings, but again–with the internet–you can connect with anyone around the world and for free.** There are many online communities that exist for almost every interest, and if you can’t find one in particular, then you have all the resources you need to make it yourself.

You don’t have to be enrolled in a college to benefit from the college community. You can move to a college town or into friends’ dorms, join college clubs, and attend college parties, all without gambling with student debt.

<blockquote>
"The only source of knowledge is experience."
<footer>–Albert Einstein</footer>
</blockquote>

You may be wondering about the adult community of college faulty, professors, and staff. How can you get that kind of support system outside of an institution?

**It’s best to learn from the people who are doing the thing that you want to do; to learn from the people who are living the life that you want to live.** (*This is why I say not to take career advice from people who hate their jobs!*) It’s best to learn from their experiences, their successes and their failures, and use that to help guide you.

- **The people who benefit the most from learning from university professors, are people who… *want to be university professors*.**
- If your original pursuit it doesn’t work out after you graduate, you can always return to your college to get a more stable living by teaching there. This is what happens to many art school graduates who struggle to make a living solely on their art (and part of what makes the thought of art school somewhat depressing).
- If you are interested in academia and writing thick academic papers and books, then you could benefit from the community of professors there.
- If you want to utilize the science research facilities, then you could benefit from the community of diverse scientists also using the facilities there.
- If you need a degree to enter your desired field (medicine, law, engineering, and teaching), then you could benefit from the community of retired professionals, who have experience in your chosen field, and who are now teaching there.

Those are the main communities offered through colleges and universities that you can benefit from. **At the end of the day, one-on-one mentorships prove to be the most valuable, and it is best to learn from the people doing the things that you want to do.** So if your desired community is not available at college, then do not fret. Use the power of the internet to find that community and build upon it. Find the people living the life that you want to live, and learn from them.

College is too expensive to require every young person to attend it by default, but for the people who stand to benefit from the above communities, then college is a beneficial step. ***College can (sometimes) be a gateway to your dreams, but it should not be the dream in it of itself.***

So, to know if college is the right gateway for your dreams or not, first you must define what they are.

### 5. A Chance to Answer the Questions "Who Am I?" and "Where do I fir in the world?"

For many years it was okay for young people to just “figure it out” at college. Of course, this was back when you could default on your student loans through bankruptcy and when the majority of students graduated with no debt to be spoken of at all. Today, that is definitely not the case.

The average student debt for 2014 graduates is over $28,000, and it is estimated that most young people won’t be able to pay of their loans until late into [their fifties](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/13/student-loan-debt_n_1668797.html). Getting higher education is no longer a no-brainer, but a lifetime-full-of-debt proposition.

College is too expensive to “figure it out” there. **Saddling yourself with a lifetime of debt before you’ve even started living is a losing proposition.**

If you can afford to gamble with college and define who you are there, than that’s something you can consider. But, all in all, the best way to find yourself is to get lost and to break away from institutions entirely for a bit. A gap year is always a low-risk option for you to define yourself, after which you can make a decision, not out of fear, but out of confidence.

### 6. Permission to Follow Your Dreams

What many of us are many looking to get out of degree is permission, the green light to go ahead and do the work we care about and to make a positive impact in the world. The approval of others to finally make that little voice in your head finally tell you that you’re good enough.

**If you love the idea of working in the above stated licensed professions, then you *do* need permission before you can do that work. For almost all other professions, though, the gatekeepers don’t really exist. They’re just in our heads.**

<blockquote>
“Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.”
<footer>–Helen Keller</footer>
</blockquote>

Don’t feel like you need to get a degree to enter your desired industry if the resulting debt could be debilitating, and especially not if that field doesn’t even care about the official credentials you have.

#### You have all the resources you need.

Anybody with high speed internet has the potential to be empowered. With so many internet postings, and so many *authors*, there is less need for *author(ity)*. There are less gatekeepers to getting your voice heard than ever before.

If your dreams don’t align with the kind of pursuits that benefit from a college degree, then don’t feel like you need to get a degree just for a degree, for an industry you aren’t interested in, just because you are looking for permission to survive.

**You don’t need permission to make a living doing the work you love because you don’t need permission to start helping people.** The world needs passionate people with new ideas, and the world needs you.

## Sometimes it's Just Not in the Cards

When I turned eighteen, I wanted nothing more than to go to art school, and very expensive art schools with sticker prices of $80,000 at that.

After a few months of sobering up from the intoxication of high school graduation, though, I took time to actually think about the decision. Artists don’t make that much money anyway, so the thought of paying off that much money *along with interest, on artist’s pay* slowly became overwhelming,

The chance of it “not working out” became even more real when I started working retail at ungodly hours of the morning, and my white-haired fifty-five year old manager looked at me with her regretful eyes and said, “You want to be an artist. Oh… I wanted to be an artist… When I was your age…”

**Humoring the possibility of the worst-case-scenario of getting an expensive art degree, I calculated the time it would’ve taken me to pay off the $80,000 student debt by working minimum wage full-time: *4.8 entire years of work, with no vacations, not accounting for student loan interest, and if I ignored basic living expenses, like I don’t know, living*.**

And seeing how it is nearly [impossible to support oneself working minimum wage](http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2013/07/19/how-she-lives-on-minimum-wage-one-mcdonalds-workers-budget/), I probably never would have been able to pay it back.

Sometimes, it’s just not in the cards. Maybe your luck is better, but as for me, I’m glad that this was one gamble I didn’t take.

## Words of Wisdom from Jim Carrey

Jim Carrey recently gave an inspirational (and, of course, funny) graduation commencement speech where he talked about how his father could have been a comedian. His father could have been a comedian, he said, but he chose to pursue a safe job, and became an accountant instead.

Then, when Jim Carrey was twelve, his father got let go from that “safe” job, and they had to struggle to survive. That’s when he learned:

<blockquote>“You can fail at what you don’t want, so you might as well take a chance doing what you love.”</blockquote>

Don’t let fear of the future taint your passions. Protect your playful spirit like treasure from the dragons of worry. Don’t let thoughts of the future cloud your experiences in the moment.

So, whether you stand to benefit from college or not, choose to be yourself. In some cases, you may find that the best possible path for you hasn’t been made yet. I’m wishing you the clarity to decide when that is and the courage to do what makes you happy no matter what.
