We millennials (the generation born during 1983-2000) are a confusing bunch. We are the Disney kids that grew up with the internet, social media, and videos games. Previous generations call us lazy and entitled. Employers declare us to be the most difficult generation to manage and can barely put up with us.

And we are the future. Scary, right?

Here are some videos to help clear the air and explain what it truly means to be a millennial. (It’s not as bad as you think.)<!--more-->

### Don’t Just Follow Your Passion: A Talk for Generation Y

While previous generations advocate work-life separation, millennials long for work-life *integration*. Not only do we want to work, but we want to be passionate about the work we are doing. This is why people are quick to call millennials lazy. We want our work to be fun, to embody who we are, and to have it make a positive impact in the world. Any work less than that will be half-assed.

We grew up with inspiring Disney movies and were told over and over again that “*You can be whatever you want to be when you grow up*,” .. and we believe it. Being told that you can pursue your passion and make a difference in the world over and over again does have its side affects. The first is that millennials find it difficult to do meaningless work. The second is that when millennials do find the work that embodies who they are, we’ll give it 110% because work *literally* is our lives.

**Some call this** (millenials not only wanting to work, but also only wanting to work for what they are passionate about) **wanting to have your cake and eat it to. To that I say: What’s the point of having cake if you can’t eat it?**

### Millennials: Who They Are & Why We Hate Them

This is a great video to show to your parents if you are a millennial. It can alleviate a lot of the conflicts that Gen Y/ Millennials can have with their Gen X parents.

This way of thinking, that not only can you get a job but that you can be choosy and get a job you love, is new. This is a luxury that we could not have if it was not for the sacrifices of previous generations. They laid the foundation for the passionate living revolution that we are living today.

Previous generations obediently did what they were told. When your grandparents told your parents to do something, they did it, no questions asked. But when parents, or managers, or any other authority figure asks a millennial to do something, “Why” is usually the first response. Millennials are purpose-driven individuals, and we don’t just take orders unless we know the bigger reason behind it. Not only are we Generation Y, but Generation *WHY* We don’t just ask, “What should we do,” we ask “*Why should we do it?*” 

**For millennials/Generation WHY, it is not just what you do, it’s *why you do it*.**

## Final Thoughts

I hope these keynotes gave you some insight into what it means to be a millennial. We’re not too different from previous generations, but we *are* different because we grew up in a different world. It’s important to be grateful to the generations that came before you and acknowledge the sacrifices they made so that you can pursue passionate work.
