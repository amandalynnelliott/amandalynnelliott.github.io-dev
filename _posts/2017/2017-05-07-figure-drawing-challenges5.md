Using see-through tracing paper for back-to-back fast gesture poses was educational in terms of movement. I’m glad with this one in particular because I did well sculpting the model out of the page with the aid of surface lines and I can feel her continued movement. It’s not static. 

### Caricature

Here’s a combination of caricature and relocation from my challenge list. 

Once I got the model’s basic form down, I couldn’t shake the feeling how aristocratic the pose felt. <!--more-->

I looked up “1800s woman illustration” to get dress reference images on my phone, and worked away.

Within a 20 minute session and using a permanent drawing tool, I felt this came out well, but I wanted to push it and exaggerate the expression farther… and thus the following sketch was born, and to date, it’s the one I'm most proud of.

Here I am breaking anatomical rules, especially with the neck, but it was necessary for a result that was so fun to achieve. Her long neck and higher vantage point gives an aura of “I’m higher, richer, and better, than you.” She is the kind of inherited aristocrat that cares about wealth in the unhealthy way; she would be found gossiping about neighbors before she ever worked or produced anything of value.

Eight months of consistent figure drawing practice opened up a whole new world for me. Attending so regularly set the stage for me to think outside the box in order to stay engaged, and that’s what led to the creation of the challenge list in the first place. 

This morning I woke up barely able to move. I’ve been so excited about some new workout routines that I committed to a schedule, and just kept going with it, even though my body was demanding a break. Now I am paying the price. 

Similarly, my mind has been demanding a break from figure drawing. If I push through without ever taking prolonged rest, I risk damaging my mind. I have now declared this a time of rest. 

Rest is just as important as action. It’s in the contrast between the two that we learn. When we rest our bodies, our muscles have time to adapt from the workout, making you stronger by healing your torn muscle fibers. The same happens with our minds—a level of integration beyond our current understanding takes place. Oftentimes it’s when you direct your attention *away* from the problem that the solution will come to you. This is why Archimedes had his great “Eureka!” moment while taking a bath.

“Obligation” and “routine” are words that should never justify not listening to your feelings on what you need to do, work or rest. I would rather train my figure drawing skills, or any skill for that matter, in high energy sprints that are unsustainable and require frequent extended breaks, than to slowly drag my feet for many miles. I’m definitely not the tortoise, but the hare. (My spirit animal is also the rabbit, so what do you know about that!)

I welcome the time when I am ready to return to these challenges with refreshed perspective and motivation. In my absence, I have at least been able to work on this blog and post series. I am continuing to live by the question, “[What would somebody who loved themselves do]({{ site.url }}/blog/2017/04/365-days-of-self-love/),” and I’m curious where it will lead me. Back to figure drawing, or to somewhere else entirely? 

I am in a sailboat. No matter how hard I try, I can’t control the winds of inspiration. I can’t make the wind appear where there is none, and I can’t make it go where I want. I am relieved that instead of getting frustrated and impatient, I now recognize wind-less times as exactly what they are: the opportunity for rest.
