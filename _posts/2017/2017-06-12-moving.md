![me and Dante]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2017/06/waterfront.jpg)

I am back in Florida now, but my stay will be short, as after some thinking, I've decidedâ€¦ This summer I'm moving to Seattle, Washington! 

It's quite a surprise to be moving clear across on the country like this, but it feels right. During my two week visit I was expecting to discover things that would make me hesitant, but it just confirmed for me that it's the right place and time to take the leap! 

Thankfully, the task of moving is not on me alone, as I'm moving in with Dante, who I stayed with during my visit.

I'm excited about a non-art job that awaits me there. While the move is in large part for the career opportunities that await, I'm looking forward to mentally separating making money from my creative work for a change. Derek Siver's post on [balance](https://sivers.org/balance) has inspired my thoughts here.

For a long time, I've been hell-bent on self-employment and making money with *my* creativity, even at the expense of my self-esteem and body. I put it all on the line and burned myself out multiple times. 

It's time for me to let go and live life. I'm sure soon enough the city will offer an abundance of opportunities. These things don't need to be forced. 

To the contrary, I've discovered that opportunities only present themselves when I *don't* desperately seek after them, and this move is no exception. The desire to move to a city has been in the back of my mind for years, but only once I [let it go]({{site.url}}/blog/2017/05/cynicism/) did the opportunity come my way! 

I couldn't be more excited.

In the meantime, I'm packing, spending time with loved ones, and of course there's so much to write about!
