Pursuing the work you’re passionate about is not as clean-cut and easy as it sounds. What if your dream is too risky? What if people think you’re crazy (undoubtedly they will)? Or what if you have no idea what your passion *even is*?

The truth is, if you don’t have the courage to pursue your dreams, or to even define them, then they’ll never be your reality. This is the truth behind why *80 percent of Americans hate their jobs*. Because, more often than not, people choose comfort over uncertainty. Following your dreams and pursuing your passion is risky business. It means losing sight of the shore and sailing to uncharted waters, to venture from the known into the unknown, and we *are afraid*.

In scouring the labyrinths of YouTube, I’ve collected these five gems: inspirational speakers tackling the issue of finding and doing passionate work. These videos have helped me through some dark times in my life, and my hope is that they will help you as well.<!--more-->

### 1. How to Find and Do the Work You Love

This video changed my life without a doubt. Without this video I still would be crying on my way to work at a retail store everyday (Which is no way to live!). Rather than to continue on as the living dead, this pushed me to quit. This is an absolute game-changer, along with Scott Dinsmore’s website, [LiveYourLegend.net](http://liveyourlegend.net/). 

I re-watch this every couple weeks to get inspired again.

### 3. Steve Job's 2005 Stanford Commencement Address

Jobs’ immensely popular speech at Stanford.

I love the part when Jobs says:

> So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.

### 4. Oprah Winfrey’s 2008 Stanford Commencement Address

Does Oprah even need an introduction?

I love it when she says:

> [My father] was always on my case, because I did not graduate. He’d say, “Oprah Gail”—that’s my middle name—”I don’t know what you’re gonna do without that degree.” And I’d say, “But, Dad, I have my own television show.”

### 5. How to Find Your Passion in 5 Minutes

The key to doing passionate work is working *for others.* Not in the sense that you have an employer, but in the sense that you have a higher purpose to serve and help other people. The key to finding passionate work is discovering the unique talents that you have within you that you can selflessly offer to the world.

Good luck in the age of art and heart!
