This post dives into how mindset shifts can lead to massive gains in skill development. The example I've applied in my life is drawing people, but the insights I've gained as a result can be applied to any skill.

Recently I've been applying my drawing skill to study human anatomy: to capture a person's personality and expression while they are going about their business in the public. For over 7 months, I've been attending weekly three-hour nude figure drawing classes, and have been people sketching at places like the mall and Walmart. 

Here's some recent work:

And here's some from right before I started regular practice:

So much of the challenge with skill acquisition is overcoming the fear of failure enough to let yourself make the mistakes required to learn anything.

I've noticed this my whole life when people would approach me while I was drawing, explaining how they "can't draw." I'd point to their perfectly functioning hands, and ask, "Why not?"

It's not that people "can't" draw--that they truly are incapable of making marks on a page--it's that they won't. They're too scared. 
Scared of messing up, of making bad art, and of their self-worth being defined by that bad art. This mindset says, "Steve makes worthless art, which means he is a worthless person. He should just give up." 

It goes without saying, that's not true. It isn't rational, but this is the kind of traumatizing event people foresee happening when they consider expressing themselves, so they jump ahead to end result they already predict: they give up. 
Unfortunately, in an attempt to avoid pain, they end up causing more of it. The pain of embarrassment is nothing compared to the pain of regret. 

#### Do yourself a favor right now and embarrass yourself. 
Do something silly and strange in public. Hug a tree at a park. Walk through the supermarket backwards. Dance in a coffee shop when your favorite song comes on. Have fun!

Come back when you've learned that you can embarrass yourself all you want, your world won't end. To the contrary, you will become stronger. 

Done? 
Okay, good.

<p class="sidenote">
Have it be known that I when I was at the mall with my friends as a preteen, and one of the quarter machines gave us a fake mustache that went perfectly with my red hair, I slapped it on and wore it all throughout the mall.
And you know the hilarious thing? Nobody even said anything. People would notice but then would avoid eye contact.
I have yet to die of the resulting embarrassment.

Moving on.

You are not defined by your embarrassing moments and if you embark on embarrassment-free life, then you are shooting all of your potential in the foot. 

Similarly, you actually ARE defined my your mistakes, but not in the bad way you would expect. You are the lessons you have learned when your actions didn't yield the results you wants. That's all a mistake is, isn't it? See, it not so scary. 

You can't have learning without mistakes.
