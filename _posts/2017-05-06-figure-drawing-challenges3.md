### Anatomy

When I’m in a more logical mood, I’ll take the long-pose opportunity to deconstruct the model’s pose to the muscular level. I look up anatomical reference images on my phone, and recreate the model to the best of my ability. I challenge myself to see all of these fibers in a three dimensional and animated way. I ask myself:

- Where do these muscle fibers connect?
- How do they twist around the form—the bones and other muscles?
- When this muscle contracts, what exactly does it move? 

With my animation goals in mind, I do my best to visualize this marionette movement in my head and internalize it.<!--more-->

A lot of what comes out when I do this challenge is guesswork—I still have a lot of work to do in this area, but it’s not my top priority anymore. I want to be able to animate believable and interesting characters, but I’m discovering that extensive anatomical knowledge is hardly a requirement for that. I take so much enjoyment from shows like *Adventure Time* where the characters are simple and sometimes defy any anatomical rules at all.

This realization doesn’t take away from how fascinating the human body is. We all have a skeleton of 206 bones covered in muscles—each a specific moving part that allow us to breathe, eat, touch, and more, all without us giving it a second thought. This sophisticated machine through which you interact with the world is entirely at your disposal, and the whole thing is composed of self-contained and functioning cells communicating with one-another!

While you won’t see me intensifying my anatomical studies by dissecting human bodies anytime soon, you may find me on the yoga mat. I’ll be working towards more challenging poses, enhancing that beautiful connection between my mind and body in a joyful way.
