A year ago I graduated high school, community college with a 2 year general degree, and turned eighteen all in the same week, which naturally triggered an existential crisis (naturally). Unable to decide on a bachelor degree program and accompanying debt-sentence, my inaction morphed into a difficult, and yet, enlightening gap year.

My gap year now officially complete, here are 14 lessons I have learned.

### 1. Don’t put happiness in future tense.

Looking back on my education, in public school, high school and community college at the same time, it was a hurdle race to nowhere. It was a frazzled rush to hurry the hell up and just get to the finish line—jump over this hurdle, and then that one, and just when you think you’re done, another row of hurdles pops up in your way.

In school, each assignment, each test, and each grade level was presented as a hurdle to be crossed and to not to be enjoyed. <b>It’s the American mentality to put happiness in future tense: happiness is to be enjoyed in the future, never now.</b> And we believe that the more we sacrifice ourselves in the present, the happier we will feel in some distant future.

Except that future never seems to come, just more hurdles, more sacrifices, and more unhappiness. You can waste your whole life thinking this way, and end up looking back full of regret.

<b>Yes, the future is something worth working towards, but you only ever live in the present.</b>

<blockquote>“Happiness wasted is happiness lost.” –unknown</blockquote>
 
### 2. Life is not a race, period.

We are all WIPs- <em>works in progress</em>, humans in training. <b>You’ll never be “done” and there is no finish line to be crossed.</b> You don’t stop learning just because you graduate school, and you cannot graduate in human.

Lose your OCD- obsessive <em>comparison</em> disorder. It’s easy with social media to compare yourself with others, your friends, public figures you admire, and your parents when they were your age, but it’s an unhealthy habit. Don’t think that just because you are a certain age that you should be at a certain point in your life.

<b>Loosen your expectations, and don’t be so hard on yourself.</b>

It reminds me of the quote by Leonardo da Vinci, “<em>Art is never finished, only abandoned.</em>” That’s what I feel life is: your career, health, relationships, and spirituality. There is no finish line in life, and you either keep growing or you abandon yourself. This is not some cut-throat rat race, but it is a JOURNEY to be enjoyed. <b>If you aren’t enjoying the journey, then you aren’t enjoying life.</b>
 
### 3. Success is a personal definition.

The most frightening aspect of my quarter-life crisis was defining what success meant. <b>In school, you’re taught to work towards the collective definition of success, like good grades, but then when you graduate you’re thrown out to sea without a preserver.</b>

<b>Now you have to decide whether to keep chasing that collective definition of success (high income, fancy cars, status symbols), or to chase internal happiness.</b>

It’s a strange feeling when you realize that you are the one ultimately in control of your life. I’ve spent most of my life working towards something that people said I had to, working towards some definition of success that wasn’t even mine. I became indoctrinated into believing that you should shut up, do what you are told, and not ask questions.

One of the biggest revelations I’ve had is that:

#### There is a difference between being engaged and being compliant.

There is a difference between learning things and doing things just because someone told you to, because it’s for a grade or a graduation requirement, and then doing things because <em>you want to.</em> You should only do things because it’ll make you happy, never because somebody told you that you had to. <b><em>Your definition of success is all your own.</em></b>
 
### 4. Less is more, and money isn’t everything.

<p class="sidenote">The Hindu Upanishads refer disdainfully to “that chain of possession to which men bind themselves and beneath which they sink.”
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Ancient Hebrew Scriptures declare that “whoever loves money never has money enough.”</p>

With consumerism all around us, we often confuse investing in material wealth with investing in personal wealth, but they are worlds apart. Experiences are your most valuable things, not your possessions. <b>Time is your only real limited resource.</b> Instead of looking to increase your personal possessions, look to increase your personal options.

<b>You will not find happiness in how you spend your money, but in how you spend <em>your time</em>.</b>
 
### 5. It’s cheaper to travel than you think.

Travel planning websites and luxury hotels don’t want you to know this, but long-term, adventurous world travel is often much cheaper than you’d think, and many times even cheaper than living that in the States.

<blockquote>“The more we associate experience with cash value, the more we think that money is what we need to live. And the more we associate money with life, the more we convince ourselves that we are too poor to buy our freedom.”

### 6. Many people hate their jobs, but you don’t have to be one of them.

<b>Do what makes you happy now, while you are young, single, and without the many responsibilities (like mouths to feed) that prevent people from taking career risks.</b> Do what makes you happy <em>now</em>, and as you build a foundation and develop your craft, you can learn how to make a living from it.

 <b>Beggars can’t be choosers, so if you can help it, don’t be a beggar.</b> You can passively wait for a better future to come, or you can actively make it (and live it!)

<blockquote>
“The future you see is the future you get.”

### 7. It’s not quitting if you are moving onto something better for yourself.

You are the one ultimately in control of your life. Don’t let fear of social judgment for being a “quitter” keep you from making a decision that will ultimate lead to your happiness.

### 8. Most school is preparation for more school.

In one short year my views of education have evolved rapidly. I am now a strong supporter of self-directed learning, or <em>unschooling</em>, which is the radical idea that students should be able to decide what they learn, when, how, and most importantly, <em>why</em>.

<blockquote>“So, how do you sidestep all that competition, the miles upon miles of jobseekers standing in employment breadlines in the same suit with the same college diploma, begging for the same job, holding in their outstretched arms–with an expectant, hopeful, yet also panicked look–their identical-seeming resumes with identical standardized credentials?
It’s very simple. Instead of jumping through the same hoops everyone else is suiting up from a young age to jump through… you need to develop a strong–violently strong–distaste for jumping through hoops.”

</blockquote>

By and large, most of what you learn about yourself, you learn in the real world,whether you <em>attend college or not</em>.
 
### 9. Self-directing your learning helps you self-direct your life.

![my books]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cc/books.png)
 
 <b>Being able to self-direct your learning full-time is rewarding and with its own share of struggles and self-doubt. You become the boss of your curriculum and life. You evolve from obedient employee following orders, to entrepreneur with the confidence, <em>and the responsibility</em>, to forge your future.</b>

You can learn a lot about yourself by simply going to the public library and seeing what nonfiction books you are drawn to. I spent the last half of my gap year exploring these books on life, education, business, and art, subscribing to interesting (and helpful) bloggers, binge watching TED Talks, giving speeches at the local Toastmasters club, and meeting interesting entrepreneurs, stock market investors, travelers, and artists through Meetup.com.

<b>There are many resources out there to help you kick-start your learning and define who you are, and the majority of them, through the internet, libraries, and meeting people, are largely free.</b>
 
### 10. It’s not what you do. It’s why you do it.

The most rewarding part of this experience has been helping people. Being approached after a speech by a woman who hates her job and is looking for a way out, or a mother who regrets forcing her son to start college and take on debt before he was ready, and being able to offer advice is humbling.

<b>Eventually, when learning, you stop learning for yourself, and start learning for others.</b>

<b>Since you are a WIP (work in progress), don’t be afraid to share your WIP projects with communities–both online and offline.</b> Do good diligence not to learn in a vacuum. Find and build a community. Help people and let people help you.
 
### 11. Conformity gets you nowhere.

![conformity man illustration]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cc/conformity-man.png)
<caption>Boxes are the death of passion, and you fit into no box.</caption>

It’s not a question of if you will become successful in life. It’s a question of if you will become successful by <em>your</em> definition.

<blockquote>
“To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best day and night to make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and never stop fighting.”
<footer>–E.E. Cummings</footer>
</blockquote>

Living the life that <em>you</em> want to live, and not the life that society <em>wants</em> you to live, will require you to not conform to society’s expectations.
Being a nonconformist, by putting your definition of success ahead of the definition of success held by others, will cause you to stand out. You will receive criticism for it—both positive and negative.

<b>Develop a strong exterior, weed out the good advice from the bad, and don’t be afraid to live your life.</b>
 
### 12. Don’t let yourself be taken advantage of for your naïve youthful ambitions.

When some see young ambitious people they see “free work.”
People posing as mentors may promise a “learning opportunity” including pay, but then may rip you off at the time of payment. It might happen once or twice, and it sucks, but after that you’ll never let it happen again.

<b>If it does happen, chop it up to nothing more than a valuable learning experience, and move on.</b>

This relates more to client-based freelance work than it does to non-paid internship opportunities. Many learning opportunities are led by honest people, but always be a little skeptical, know how much you value your time, and trust your gut.
 
### 13. Don’t get paralyzed in the fear of failure.

<blockquote>“There’s no difference between a pessimist who says, ‘Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing anything,’ and an optimist who says, ‘Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine anyway.’ Either way, nothing happens.”
<footer>–Yvon Chouinard</footer>
</blockquote>

Failure is a part of life, not a death sentence.

Unlike in school where the act of failing is punished, in the real world you should treat failure like the valuable learning experience it is.

<b>The more you fail, the more you learn. The quicker you fail, the quicker you learn.</b>

<em>Never bet more on a project than you are willing to lose</em>, and always anticipate a Plan B if anything you do fails. <b>It is only failure if you give up and stop trying entirely. If you pick yourself up again, you become stronger, more resilient, and smarter.</b>
 
### 14. Don’t get paralyzed in the pursuit of perfection.

<b>Perfection doesn’t exist, so take comfort in the fact that you will never be perfect.</b> (I’ve done my best to remove that word from my vocabulary.)

<b>Perfect <em>timing</em> doesn’t exist either, and if you wait for perfect timing before doing anything, then you’ll be waiting forever and a day.</b> Quite frankly, the timing is <em>never</em> right. Take action anyway.

Take comfort in the fact that you can leave things imperfect before showing them to the world, <em>including yourself.</em>
 
## Gap Year Final Thoughts

If you are unsure of your goals or direction in life, a gap year is always an option for you to relax and explore your possibilities. <b>It’s a low pressure way to figure out who you are and where you want to go.</b>

Never feel pressured to go to college to get a degree just for a degree. You can decide that when you are ready.

Relax, take some time to yourself, and remember that you are not alone.

<b>The more you explore, the more you discover yourself.</b> Don’t be afraid to venture off the beaten path.
