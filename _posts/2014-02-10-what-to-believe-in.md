What you believe in matters. It determines everything you do in life. It motivates you and gives you hope when you have nothing left. *It gives you a reason to live.*

**What you believe in determines everything.** 

I firmly believe that…
- **you can have the job that embodies who you are** and that fulfills you; enjoyment should not be restricted to weekends and vacations.
- **passion is not a luxury, but a *necessity*, to a happy and fulfilled life.**
- every human being is a unique individual with a unique set of talents, skills, goals, and interests.
- **passion, not grades or graduation requirements, should be the primary motivator to learn.**
- cookie-cutter education systems that force everyone to conform to the same goals alienate individuals from their unique passions.
- it is through experiences outside of the classroom that you learn what matters.
- life can be fulfilling and full of adventure, but only if you will it.
