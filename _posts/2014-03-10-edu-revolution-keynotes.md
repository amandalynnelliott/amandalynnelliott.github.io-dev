We are in the midst of an education revolution.

Brilliant minds all over the world are challenging the industrial and dated way of educating, and are bringing student empowerment, passion, and creativity to center stage.

### 1. The Five Minute University

Father Guido Sarducci is a chain-smoking priest with tinted glasses, a character made famous by comedian Don Novello.

I often re-watch this because it is hilariously true.<!--more-->

### 2. Why I Hate School But Love Education

Why do the most successful people in the world not attribute school to their success?

Do the people who find success in finding the work that they are passionate about–do they do so *because* of their education, or in spite of it? All evidence points to in spite of, but then, what is the point of education?

AND to answer just that–What is school for– we have…

### 3. Stop Stealing Dreams – Seth Godin

What is school for? It’s not what you think, and the answer is surprising.

The school system isn’t broken, because it’s doing exactly what we intended it do. The world is changing rapidly and education can’t keep up, because we didn’t design it to.

### 4. RSA Animate – Changing Education Paradigms

How do we educate children to take their place in the economies of the 21st century when we can’t anticipate what the economy will look like *next week*?

Tackling that question is educationalist Sir Ken Robinson, an English author, speaker, and creativity expert.

### 5. Education is NOT the Same as Schooling

## Final Thoughts

I hope these keynotes gave you some food for thought. They sure have for me.

I stumbled upon these videos while in high school, and the epiphanies hit me like a ton of bricks: we hadn’t been *learning*, we had been testing! We readily assume that testing and learning are one in the same, but they could not be more different.

Our obsession with data is ruining education. We spend more time preparing students for tests than we do for life.  How can you discover your talents, your passions, *who you are and where you fit into the world*, when school forces you to conform to everyone else?

Questioning education- why it is the way it is, and how it can be- is an ongoing conversation, on local, national, and global levels. These conversations have the potential to determine the future of education as we know it.
