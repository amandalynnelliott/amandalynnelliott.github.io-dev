My trip to Las Vegas was amazing, and the highlight, believe it or not, was hiking and spending time with family. (Not that I could gamble or drink even if I wanted to.) It was also interesting seeing wedding chapels more rampant than fast food restaurants.

It was my first time traveling without my parents, and it gave me a sense of independence.

Now I’m back in Florida, and relieved to be in one-hundred percent humid air again!

Now it’s also time to face facts. I’ve burned up most of my savings for the trip, and now it’s time to start thinking about money.

I’ve been looking forward to starting substitute teaching all summer, but the age requirement in my district just changed to twenty-one. Apparently twenty-one-year-olds get to have ALL the fun.

When I found out the news, it was like a rug was pulled from under my feet. How was I going to make money now?<!--more-->

### Fear is bondage.

I’ve been feeling off the last few weeks, and I just realized why: because I’ve been motivated by Fear.

It feels like I’ve been motivated by fear my whole life. That’s how our current educational system operations—you’re either motivated by fear (of failure), or you’re not motivated at all. (More on that in a future post, but the bottom line is, we should be trying to produce positively motivated students instead of “smart” students.)

Fear is what kickstarted my [gap year]({{ site.url }}/blog/2014/05/gap-year/). When I decided to prolong finishing college indefinitely, I went into high-gear, consuming any information I could find on how to be successful without a bachelor’s degree.

However, in doing that I didn’t feel like I was living because I had put happiness in future-tense. Slowly, I realized that life is journey to be enjoyed, not a race. I realized that if you’re not enjoying the journey, then you’re not enjoying life.

While I’ve been out of school for a year, managed to set up this site, host workshops, public speak, and learn a great deal through books and meeting people, I still find myself riddled with self-doubt.

Even though I’ve told myself that I’m done being motivated by fear, again and again, it keeps manifesting. While fear is a fantastic motivator, if not the strongest motivator, it’s unhealthy. I’d go so far as to say that it’s fear in the workplace that causes many Americans to lead unhealthy lives. Even though we live in great abundance and have no shortage of great medical facilities and doctors, we have the most people dying from avoidable illnesses, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

Why?

Because we are highly motivated by fear… and that’s killing us. In the fear of perishing, we perish ourselves.

Fear is what allowed us to survive as a species, and for that reason, fear is good, but only in short bursts. Fear is poisonous if induced over long periods of time. Fear, and the stress that comes with it, is poisonous to our health, fulfillment, and happiness.

### Free yourself from needless suffering.

The only thing that should be motivating you is yourself, your values, your passion, and your desire to help people. If you are motivated by external gains (fear, grades, money, your number of followers, etc) then you won’t feel truly fulfilled.

The problem with external gains is that it is never enough. The carrot stick keeps moving. You got 100 followers? That’s great. But it’s not as great as 200. Then you get 200, and then guess what, you’re still not happy.

Though it hurts digging up internalized fears, doing so is well worth it to figure out what is truly motivating you. You can either blame the world for being afraid, or you can take charge of your motivations. Deconstruct your fears, accept them, and become motivated NOT to be motivated by fear. Defining your fears is the first step.

After a few contemplative hours, I’ve discovered that my primary motivators from fear are:

1.	Disappointing my parents (praise)
2.	Not being able to support myself doing what I love, meaning that I’d have to take a job I hate or don’t believe in to live (money)
3.	Being homeless (money)
4.	People not caring about my work (praise)

I find myself constantly comparing myself to other bloggers/ vloggers, who have huge audiences. I find myself getting envious of their collaborating power. Of course, this comparison is not fair, because it takes years of dedicated work to build an audience. I guess in my fear-ridden mind, that’s unacceptable. I have become my own worst teacher—impossible to please, and easy to disappoint.

I am also afraid that I won’t be able to sustain myself on my passions as a college dropout. No matter how many successful dropouts I meet who have done so, for some reason I feel like I can’t.

<p class="sidenote">
Verse Three of the “Tao Te Ching” reads:<br><br>

When praise is lavished upon the famous,<br>
the people contend and compete with one another.<br>
When exotic goods are traded and treasured,<br>
the compulsion to steal is felt.<br>
When desires are constantly stimulated,<br>
people become disturbed and confused.<br><br>

Therefore, the wise person sets an example by<br>
Emptying her mind<br>
Opening her heart,<br>
Relaxing her ambitions,<br>
Relinquishing her desires,<br>
Cultivating her character.<br>
Having conquering her own cunning an cravings,<br>
She can’t be manipulated by anyone.<br><br>

Do by not-doing.<br>
Act with nonaction.<br>
Allow order to arise of itself.<br>
</p>

For the praise-rooted fear motivators, work on seeing success through *your* own eyes and soul, not somebody else’s. Just because your friend size is small, doesn’t mean that they don’t matter. It is not the number of stars you have, but the beauty in the constellations you make. Just because a star is dim and seen by few, doesn’t mean that the light and warmth it gives off doesn’t matter.

I lost sight of that because my true motivator is fear of not having money, which I linked to praise when I set my mind to becoming self-employed by building an audience.

For money-rooted fears, you have to trust that society provides to those that provides to it. Don’t set unrealistic expectations for yourself, and don’t expect to find happiness in a fixed amount of money.

I’m even considering living in poverty for a while to experience my fear firsthand.

The next book on my list to read is called *The Man Who Quit Money* by Mark Sundeen. The book is about the life of Daniel Suelo, a University of Colorado graduate, who goes from a prestigious 9-5 job, to deciding to quit money. To some he is a homeless bum. To others he is a philosophical leader. He travels the world, living in caves, in sleeping bags, and under tarps.

What separates Daniel Suelo from many other homeless people, or at least my perception of them, is that he *wants* to be homeless. He is not sick, he is not angry or depressed, but is actually like a modern-day Walden, at peace and sharing his happiness with everyone around him.

Money, as I’m slowly coming to realize, is not something that is worth worrying about. Worrying about a future where you might not have money is a terrible way to waste the present. Don’t worry about the future, because it comes soon enough. And even if you fall upon hard times, I’m sure you have a family member or a good friend or two that would be willing to help you out.

The truth is, none of that craps matters, and the only thing that should matter is that you’re living every day to its fullest through your passions and helping people. The other stuff comes with it as soon as you stop thinking about it.

You need to separate fear from your thoughts. You know who you are. You know what your values are and what you bring to society. Any voice in your head that says that nothing you do matters is the fear talking, not you.

I’m tired of being motivated by fear. I just want to help people, and have fun and feel happy doing it. Making the transition from fear-motivation to love-motivation isn’t like a flick of a switch, but more like an ongoing effort. Be motivated NOT to be motivated by fear.

Self-fulfillment is not an end goal you reach, but an ongoing pursuit. Do any yoga pose, and you’ll understand the metaphor that balance is not something that is reached, but something that is constantly worked at and maintained.

### The Alternative

*The mediator between the head and the hands MUST be the heart.*

When motivated by Fear, you try to gain praise and that leads to competition.

The alternative is being motivated by Altruism, which amounts to trying to spread peace and joy and that leads to cooperation.

Follow your heart and you won’t go astray. Make love the beginning and end of your heart. Shut out the darkness and live in the day.

#### It takes time.

Another important thing to realize is that if you are on a similar credential-absent route, then unlike college students, you don’t have the luxury of knowing how long it’ll be until your skills are good enough to make a living. (Of course, that doesn’t always work for college graduates in practice, but it can be a blissful ignorance.)

As alternative education seekers, we don’t have this luxury. However, understand that it will take time. Don’t get discouraged if you can’t make a living with your desired skills right away, because that’s unrealistic. Even if you aren’t enrolled, you’re still a student. ***Skill = Effort x Time***

Be sure to seek advice from mentors to evaluate your skill set, to see what you’re doing right and what needs improvement.

Since I can’t substitute teach, I’m going to try dipping my toes in my true passion, editorial illustration. (I absolutely love illustrating for these blog posts.) I’ll contact illustrators I admire to get advice, along with potential clients, and I’ll let you know how it goes!
