This is my shirt from my days of college bookstore employment. Most college bookstores in the U.S. are owned by Barnes & Noble, and they are making a killing on profits because the only thing skyrocketing faster than tuition prices is [textbook prices](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/04/college-textbook-prices-increase_n_2409153.html).<!--more-->

Even after tuition and room and board costs, textbooks are a formidable obstacle for broke college students. Students would come up to my register with a heavy tower of tomes, and *the average cost I would cashier a student for just one semester of books was 700 dollars.*

Our bookstore policy was to give students only *one week*—the first week of classes—to return books for a full refund.

At the end of the semester, I would then see the same students return to sell the books back and get completely ripped off.

With the online open educational resources movement, you can read that content for free online, or at a library. I began to feel like we were running a scam, asking students to pay egregious amounts for information that they could get *for free* elsewhere, and so I got into the habit of talking students out of buying their textbooks.

### The Future of Textbooks

![textbooks]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/cc/textbooks-close.jpg)

Why are textbooks so important? A textbook is a *manual* on a subject. It’s boring, dense, and quickly outdated information.

When’s the last time you went to a bookstore and said, “I want that latest riveting thing that is changing the world. Can you get me that TEXTBOOK?” Never. When you buy a textbook you aren’t buying ideas. You’re buying a manual. With the internet there is no need for manuals.

*The very idea of a textbook is becoming obsolete, because **the internet is the ultimate textbook**.*

I told this to customers in the college bookstore when they came up to my register to checkout with their tower of tomes. It felt awesome helping people save hundreds of dollars. But who didn’t find it as awesome… were my managers. (I don’t work there anymore…)

### A Complete Scam?

This quote is from the comment section of [this article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/04/college-textbook-prices-increase_n_2409153.html).

<blockquote>
I worked for college textbook publishers for 12 years. A lot of the cost was for simple greed and expensive compensation packages for management. Every year we had 2 very expensive sales meetings at resorts with lavish accommodations and free spending. I’ve seen sales representative run up huge bills on alcohol and food at these meetings and of course it was all expensed back to the company and then passed along to the students. <b>In our meetings we plotted how to drive up the costs, not how to provide value. We tried every trick you could imagine to make books more expensive and have less shelf life.</b> The cost to print the books was a tiny fraction of what was charged. Most of the money went to corporate executives and their lavish bonuses and trips. I remember one time our CEO came to work with me and he reserved an entire floor of a major hotel to stay at for a week. He worked with me for one day and stayed in the hotel for a whole week living like a king. If you eliminated the greed and excess from the industry books would cost a fraction of what they cost now. It was shameful the way we operated.<br>
…<br>
Anyone who has ever worked in the industry can tell you similar stories. <b>Our goal was to bleed the students for every dime possible, if we could have created books that self destructed at the end of the semester I believe that we would have.</b>

### The Solution

Always check your local library before buying a book. Many times it’s as easy as logging into their website and placing the book on hold, or reading the ebook right then and there.

By using the library, I’ll be able to read 68 of the books on my 100 book list for free. That’s not even including the savings from getting free information from online blogs and free ebooks.

If you are a student taking classes that require textbooks, ask *former students *of the professor if the book will be used. Many times professors have to require a textbook for their classes, even if they don’t use them. When in doubt, trust the opinions of students. As always, check the library at your school first, and if it so happens that you do have to purchase a textbook, share costs with a classmate, buy used, and rent when possible.

Always keep in mind: ***lifelong learning doesn’t require lifelong debt.***
