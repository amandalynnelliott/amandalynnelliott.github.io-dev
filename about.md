I'm a writer and illustrator living in Brevard County, Florida.
I read a lot, do a lot, think a lot, and get a lot of ideas. Some of these ideas get polished enough to become the gems I put on display in this blog.

My work is motivated by this question: How can I communicate the most amount of content in the most potent way possible? The quickest, simplest,  most impactful way?

The journey has led to me to leverage my drawing passion that I've exercised since childhood, along with developing a writing skill that I improved through my Cheating College blog I ran in 2014-5. I also practice public speaking, and explore visual thinking techniques from the obscure field of graphic facilitation.

I'm currently focused on teaching myself animation of the two kinds of flavors: Disney-style frame-by-frame animation, and web animation made with CSS and JavaScript.

To test these different methods of content-delivery, I tackle the most abstract and complex problems that excite me. I research and study the selected problem until I get hit with an insight, usually in the form of a clear and simple solution. For example, see this College Gamble Flowchart [link].

To find problems to dissect for these high-level projects, I study, experiment, and explore the questions that stem from this question: How we can live better, both as individuals and as a society?

This blog is my outlet for sharing what I discover along this journey.

Post topics range from skill development, creativity, philosophy, life lessons, how society and institutions can be improved, and project implementation... I have many interests, so essentially anything I feel others may benefit from.

I make the work I want to see exist in the world.
It makes me happy to create this work, and so, I share it with you.
